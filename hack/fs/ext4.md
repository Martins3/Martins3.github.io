/*
 * The ext4_map_blocks() function tries to look up the requested blocks,
 * and returns if the blocks are already mapped.
 *
 * Otherwise it takes the write lock of the i_data_sem and allocate blocks
 * and store the allocated blocks in the result buffer head and mark it
 * mapped.
 *
 * If file type is extents based, it will call ext4_ext_map_blocks(),
 * Otherwise, call with ext4_ind_map_blocks() to handle indirect mapping
 * based files
 *
 * On success, it returns the number of blocks being mapped or allocated.  if
 * create==0 and the blocks are pre-allocated and unwritten, the resulting @map
 * is marked as unwritten. If the create == 1, it will mark @map as mapped.
 *
 * It returns 0 if plain look up failed (blocks have not been allocated), in
 * that case, @map is returned as unmapped but we still do fill map->m_len to
 * indicate the length of a hole starting at map->m_lblk.
 *
 * It returns the error in case of allocation failure.

One caller of `ext4_map_blocks` is ext4_get_block


Although aops::write_begin will write page to disk, but it will write journal to disk, analyzing `__block_write_begin` will verify this.
`__generic_file_write_iter` ==> generic_perform_write ==> address_space_operations::write_begin == ext4_write_begin ==> `__block_write_begin`
