/proc/stat
              kernel/system statistics.  Varies with architecture.
              Common entries include:

              cpu 10132153 290696 3084719 46828483 16683 0 25195 0
              175628 0
              cpu0 1393280 32966 572056 13343292 6130 0 17875 0 23933 0
                     The amount of time, measured in units of USER_HZ
                     (1/100ths of a second on most architectures, use
                     sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) to obtain the right value),
                     that the system ("cpu" line) or the specific CPU
                     ("cpuN" line) spent in various states:

                     user   (1) Time spent in user mode.

                     nice   (2) Time spent in user mode with low
                            priority (nice).

                     system (3) Time spent in system mode.

                     idle   (4) Time spent in the idle task.  This value
                            should be USER_HZ times the second entry in
                            the /proc/uptime pseudo-file.

                     iowait (since Linux 2.5.41)
                            (5) Time waiting for I/O to complete.  This
                            value is not reliable, for the following
                            reasons:

                            1. The CPU will not wait for I/O to
                               complete; iowait is the time that a task
                               is waiting for I/O to complete.  When a
                               CPU goes into idle state for outstanding
                               task I/O, another task will be scheduled
                               on this CPU.

                            2. On a multi-core CPU, the task waiting for
                               I/O to complete is not running on any
                               CPU, so the iowait of each CPU is
                               difficult to calculate.

                            3. The value in this field may decrease in
                               certain conditions.

                     irq (since Linux 2.6.0)
                            (6) Time servicing interrupts.

                     softirq (since Linux 2.6.0)
                            (7) Time servicing softirqs.

                     steal (since Linux 2.6.11)
                            (8) Stolen time, which is the time spent in
                            other operating systems when running in a
                            virtualized environment

                     guest (since Linux 2.6.24)
                            (9) Time spent running a virtual CPU for
                            guest operating systems under the control of
                            the Linux kernel.

                     guest_nice (since Linux 2.6.33)
                            (10) Time spent running a niced guest
                            (virtual CPU for guest operating systems
                            under the control of the Linux kernel).

              page 5741 1808
                     The number of pages the system paged in and the
                     number that were paged out (from disk).

              swap 1 0
                     The number of swap pages that have been brought in
                     and out.

              intr 1462898
                     This line shows counts of interrupts serviced since
                     boot time, for each of the possible system
                     interrupts.  The first column is the total of all
                     interrupts serviced including unnumbered
                     architecture specific interrupts; each subsequent
                     column is the total for that particular numbered
                     interrupt.  Unnumbered interrupts are not shown,
                     only summed into the total.

              processes 86031
                     Number of forks since boot.

                     Number of processes blocked waiting for I/O to
                     complete.  (Linux 2.5.45 onward.)
