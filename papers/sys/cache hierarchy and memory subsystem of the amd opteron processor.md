# cache hierarchy and memory subsystem of amd opteron processor

1. Probe filter

2. Such an approach has achieved high batch throughput on some commercial workloads, but has limitations when response time (latency), distribution of response times (quality of service, or QoS), and user experience are a concern
> Qos is what, distribution of response time, why thread process parallsim has limitation on this ?

3. mutiprocessing mode
> need more professional explanation

4.
workloads with low parallelism, the highest performance will likely be achieved by a CMP built from more complex cores capable of exploiting instruction-level parallelism from the small number of available software threads
> from the small number of avaliable software threads, how to explain it
