It does
not help you, in my opinion, to be closer to 4.0 as opposed to 3.5.
> now, take care of your gpa it alread ok, if there is no research background, we are dying now !


Generally, a score of less than 22-23 on the Speaking
TOEFL tells us that we may have a lot of trouble understanding you. This will
definitely hurt your chances of admission.

It’s misleading that the personal statement is called a “personal” statement, since
what admission committees are really looking for is a research statement.

Note that prior research experience does not mean that you need to have
published a paper. It does not even mean that your research needs to have yielded a
result – results can sometimes take years. We just need to have confidence that you
know what doing research is like

At CMU we mark all letters like letter 1 with the
acronym D.W.I.C.. This stands for “Did Well In Class” which counts for 0, since
we already know from the student’s transcript that he did well in class.

You want words like
**self-motivated**, **strong research potential**, **own initiative**, **independent**, and **driven**
to appear in your letters.

It makes a difference whom you ask for a letter. A letter counts
a lot more if the admissions committee knows the recommender.
