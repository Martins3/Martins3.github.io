## Code Style

- [Microsoft Rust Guidelines](https://microsoft.github.io/rust-guidelines) - external reference
- `cargo fmt` for formatting, `cargo clippy` for linting (enforced in CI)
- Async-first (Tokio runtime)
- `Send + Sync` for public types

Key guidelines to internalize:
- **M-PANIC-IS-STOP**: Panics terminate, don't use for error handling
- **M-CONCISE-NAMES**: Avoid "Service", "Manager", "Factory" in type names
- **M-UNSAFE**: Minimize and document all unsafe blocks

**Python:**
- Async/await for all I/O
- Context managers (`async with`) for automatic cleanup
- Type hints encouraged

## Workflows

**Development workflow:**
1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Make changes, add tests, update docs
3. Run `cargo test && make fmt`
4. Open Pull Request
5. Address code review feedback
6. Squash merge to main

**Testing:**
- Rust: `cargo test` (unit + integration)
- Python: `pytest` with real VM integration tests

**For complete workflows, see:**
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-contribute) - PR process, testing, release
- [.github/workflows/](../.github/workflows/) - CI/CD pipelines

## Important Notes

## Mandatory Code Design Rules

**CRITICAL: These rules are MANDATORY for all code contributions.**

### Meta-Principle

**0. DON'T BE YES MAN** - Challenge assumptions, question designs, identify flaws

- **Challenge yourself too, not just the user**
- Before implementing: "Does this already exist?" (search first)
- Before adding logic: "Does this layer need to know this?"
- After writing: "What breaks if I delete this?"

### Core Principles (Must Know)

**1. Single Responsibility** - One function, one job
**2. Boring Code** - Obvious > clever
**3. Search Before Implement** - grep before writing, read before coding
**4. Only What's Used** - No future-proofing, delete dead code immediately
**5. DRY** - Don't Repeat Yourself (single source of truth)
**6. Explicit Errors** - Self-documenting error messages

### Supporting Principles (Reference When Needed)

**7. Minimal Knowledge** - Components only know interfaces, not internals
**8. No Premature Optimization** - Measure first, optimize later
**9. Explicit Paths** - Calculate from known roots, never assume
**10. Prepare Before Execute** - Setup before irreversible operations
**11. Validate Early** - Check preconditions before expensive work
**12. Thoughtful Naming** - Consider 5+ alternatives, choose the clearest
**13. Structured Code** - Organized hierarchy, clear layers, predictable organization
**14. Idiomatic by Default** - Follow each language's standard patterns and libraries first; only diverge with a clear, documented reason
**15. No Sleep for Events** - Never use `sleep` to wait on events (especially > 10ms). Use proper event-driven mechanisms (channels, waitpid, condition variables, futures) instead.

### Quick Examples

**DON'T BE YES MAN**

Critical thinking is mandatory. Challenge assumptions, identify flaws, propose better alternatives.

```
// ❌ Yes Man behavior
User: "Let's add a Supervisor component to track metrics"
AI: "Great idea! I'll implement it right away."
[Creates empty struct with no implementation, violates YAGNI]

// ✅ Critical thinking
User: "Let's add a Supervisor component to track metrics"
AI: "Wait - what data would Supervisor need? The process handle is in ShimController.
     Creating a separate component means duplicating PID tracking (violates DRY).
     Supervisor has no access to the data it needs. This design won't work.

     Better approach: ShimController already owns the process, it should provide metrics.
     Do you want me to implement metrics() in ShimController instead?"
```

**Real example from this codebase:**

- Initial design had empty `Supervisor` struct that did nothing
- Yes-man would have kept it or implemented it wrong
- Critical analysis identified: violates YAGNI, DRY, and "Delete Legacy Code"
- Solution: Delete Supervisor, add metrics to ShimController (owns the process)

**When to push back:**

- Design violates any of the 15 golden rules
- User requests create duplicate state/logic
- Implementation requires blocking operations (sleep, sync I/O in async contexts)
- Code adds complexity without clear benefit
- "Future-proofing" that isn't needed now (YAGNI)

**How to push back:**

1. Identify specific rule violations
2. Explain why current approach won't work
3. Propose concrete alternative
4. Let user decide

**Remember:** Respectful disagreement > harmful agreement. Your job is to build good code, not to please.

**Single Responsibility**

```rust
// ❌ One function doing everything
fn setup_and_start_vm(image: &str) -> Result<VM> { /* ... */ }

// ✅ Each function has one job
fn pull_image(image: &str) -> Result<Manifest> { /* ... */ }
fn create_workspace(manifest: &Manifest) -> Result<Workspace> { /* ... */ }
fn start_vm(workspace: &Workspace) -> Result<VM> { /* ... */ }
```

**Boring Code**

```rust
// ❌ Clever, hard to understand
fn metrics(&self) -> RawMetrics {
    self.process.as_ref()
        .and_then(|p| System::new().process(Pid::from(p.id())))
        .map(|proc| RawMetrics { cpu: proc.cpu_usage(), mem: proc.memory() })
        .unwrap_or_default()
}

// ✅ Boring, obvious
fn metrics(&self) -> RawMetrics {
    if let Some(ref process) = self.process {
        let mut sys = System::new();
        sys.refresh_process(pid);
        if let Some(proc_info) = sys.process(pid) {
            return RawMetrics {
                cpu_percent: Some(proc_info.cpu_usage()),
                memory_bytes: Some(proc_info.memory()),
            };
        }
    }
    RawMetrics::default()
}
```

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**

```rust
// ❌ Duplicated constants
const VSOCK_PORT: u32 = 2695;  // host
const VSOCK_PORT: u32 = 2695;  // guest

// ✅ Shared in core crate
use crate::VSOCK_GUEST_PORT;
```

**Search Before Implement**

BEFORE writing ANY code, search for existing implementations:

```bash
# ❌ Writing transformation without searching
# (adds duplicate unix→vsock transformation in litebox.rs)

# ✅ Search first, find existing code
$ grep -r "transform.*guest" boxlite/src/
boxlite/src/engines/krun/engine.rs:113:fn transform_guest_args(...)
# → Found it! Use existing code, don't duplicate.
```

```rust
// ❌ Duplicate logic in wrong layer
impl BoxInitializer {
    fn create_guest_entrypoint(&self, transport: &Transport) -> GuestEntrypoint {
        // Why does litebox know about krun's unix→vsock transformation?
        let guest_transport = match transport {
            Transport::Unix { .. } => Transport::vsock(2695),  // Already in krun/engine.rs!
            ...
        };
    }
}

// ✅ Let existing engine code handle it
impl BoxInitializer {
    fn create_guest_entrypoint(&self, transport: &Transport) -> GuestEntrypoint {
        // Pass transport as-is, krun engine will transform if needed
        let uri = transport.to_uri();
        format!("exec boxlite-guest --listen {}", uri)
    }
}

// Engine already has the transformation (discovered via grep)
impl EngineKrun {
    fn transform_guest_args(args: Vec<String>) -> Vec<String> {
        // Krun-specific: unix:// → vsock:// transformation
    }
}
```

**Search patterns to try:**

- Similar functionality: `grep -r "transform.*args" src/`
- Function names: `grep -r "function_name" src/`
- Constants/config: `grep -r "VSOCK_PORT\|2695" src/`
- Layer ownership: `grep -r "GUEST_AGENT" src/` (shows which modules use it)

**Explicit Path Calculation**

```rust
// ❌ Assumes relationship
let box_dir = rootfs_dir.join(box_id);

// ✅ Calculate from known root
let home_dir = rootfs_dir.parent().ok_or(...) ?;
let box_dir = home_dir.join(dirs::BOXES_DIR).join(box_id);
```

**Only What's Used**

```rust
// ❌ Adding "future-proof" code
pub struct Supervisor {
    // Empty - we might need this later!
}

// ❌ Keeping "just in case" code
// fn old_extract_layers() { ... }  // Commented out, might need later?

// ✅ Only implement what's needed now
// If Supervisor isn't used, don't create it
// If old code isn't called, delete it (it's in git history)
```

**Prepare Before Execute**

```rust
// ❌ Setup mixed with critical operation
fn start_vm() -> Result<()> {
    let ctx = create_ctx()?;
    ctx.start();  // Process takeover - can't recover from errors!
}

// ✅ All setup before point of no return
std::fs::create_dir_all( & socket_dir) ?;  // Can fail safely
let ctx = create_ctx() ?;                 // Can fail safely
ctx.configure() ?;                        // Can fail safely
ctx.start();                             // Point of no return
```

**Explicit Error Context**

```rust
// ❌ Generic error
std::fs::create_dir_all( & dir) ?;

// ✅ Self-documenting
std::fs::create_dir_all( & socket_dir).map_err( | e| {
BoxliteError::Storage(format ! (
"Failed to create socket directory {}: {}", socket_dir.display(), e
))
}) ?;
```

**Thoughtful Naming**

```rust
// ❌ Unclear, abbreviated
fn proc_data(d: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> { /* ... */ }
fn get_stuff() -> Result<Thing> { /* ... */ }

// ✅ Clear, self-documenting (considered alternatives first)
// Alternatives considered: handle_layers, merge_layers, combine_layers, stack_layers
fn extract_and_merge_layers(tarballs: &[PathBuf], dest: &Path) -> Result<()> { /* ... */ }

// Alternatives considered: fetch_config, load_config, read_config, get_config
fn parse_container_config(manifest: &Manifest) -> Result<ContainerConfig> { /* ... */ }
```

**Naming Process**:

1. Write down 5+ name candidates
2. Consider: verb clarity, noun specificity, context
3. Ask: "If I read this in 6 months, would it be obvious?"
4. Choose the name that needs the least explanation

**Minimal Knowledge**

```rust
// ❌ Component knows about other's internals
mod krun_engine {
    use crate::networking::constants::GUEST_MAC;

    fn configure_network(&self, socket_path: &str) {
        // Engine directly imports networking constant
        self.ctx.add_net_path(socket_path, GUEST_MAC);
    }
}

// ✅ Component only knows interface
mod krun_engine {
    fn configure_network(&self, socket_path: &str, mac_address: [u8; 6]) {
        // Engine receives mac_address as parameter, doesn't know where it comes from
        self.ctx.add_net_path(socket_path, mac_address);
    }
}

// Backend provides the configuration
mod gvproxy_backend {
    use crate::networking::constants::GUEST_MAC;

    fn endpoint(&self) -> NetworkBackendEndpoint {
        NetworkBackendEndpoint::UnixSocket {
            path: self.socket_path.clone(),
            mac_address: GUEST_MAC,  // Backend knows the constant
        }
    }
}
```

**Why this matters:**

- Loose coupling: Components don't know each other's internals
- Independent evolution: Backend and engine can change independently
- Testability: Components can be tested in isolation

**Anti-pattern: Knowledge Leaks**

```rust
// ❌ litebox.rs knowing about krun's socket bridging
impl BoxInitializer {
    fn create_guest_entrypoint(&self) -> GuestEntrypoint {
        // Why does litebox know about krun's unix→vsock transformation?
        let guest_transport = match transport {
            Transport::Unix { .. } => Transport::vsock(2695),  // ← Krun implementation detail!
            ...
        };
    }
}

// ✅ Let the engine handle its own implementation details
impl BoxInitializer {
    fn create_guest_entrypoint(&self, transport: &Transport) -> GuestEntrypoint {
        // Pass transport as-is, let engine transform if needed
        let uri = transport.to_uri();
        format!("exec boxlite-guest --listen {}", uri)
    }
}

// Engine handles the transformation
impl EngineKrun {
    fn transform_guest_args(args: Vec<String>) -> Vec<String> {
        // Krun-specific: unix:// → vsock:// transformation
    }
}
```

**Ask before adding logic:**

- Does THIS component need to know this detail?
- Would removing this knowledge make the system more flexible?
- Is this an implementation detail of a different layer?

**Minimal Knowledge applies to EVERYTHING:**

- ✅ Code (imports, function calls, direct references)
- ✅ **Comments** (what implementation details are revealed)
- ✅ Documentation (API contracts, design docs)

```rust
// ❌ Comment reveals implementation details
fn create_guest_entrypoint(&self, transport: &Transport) -> GuestEntrypoint {
    // Pass transport as-is - krun engine will transform unix:// to vsock://
    // (see krun/engine.rs::transform_guest_args)
    // ↑ Why does litebox know krun's transformation logic?
    let uri = transport.to_uri();
}

// ✅ Comment maintains abstraction
fn create_guest_entrypoint(&self, transport: &Transport) -> GuestEntrypoint {
    // Engine handles any transport-specific transformations
    // ↑ Generic, no implementation details leaked
    let uri = transport.to_uri();
}
```

**Why comments matter:**

- Comments create **documentation coupling** (if implementation changes, comment is wrong)
- Revealing "how" instead of "why" leaks abstractions
- Future readers learn the wrong patterns

**Structured Code**

```rust
// ❌ Flat, disorganized
mod rootfs {
    pub fn prepare() { ... }
    pub fn extract() { ... }
    pub fn mount() { ... }
    pub fn unmount() { ... }
    pub fn process_whiteouts() { ... }
    pub struct PreparedRootfs {
        ...
    }
    pub struct SimpleRootfs {
        ...
    }
}

// ✅ Hierarchical, organized by responsibility
mod rootfs {
    mod operations;  // Low-level primitives
    mod prepared;    // High-level orchestration (uses operations)
    mod simple;      // Alternative implementation

    pub use operations::{extract_layer_tarball, mount_overlayfs_from_layers};
    pub use prepared::PreparedRootfs;
    pub use simple::SimpleRootfs;
}
```

**Structure Principles**:

1. **Clear Hierarchy**: operations → prepared → public API
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has ONE purpose
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: High-level API first, details hidden
4. **Predictable Organization**: Similar things organized similarly
5. **Explicit Dependencies**: Imports show relationships
6. **Testable Isolation**: Each layer can be tested independently

**File Organization Pattern**:

```
src/
  ├── lib.rs              // Public API only
  ├── errors.rs           // Shared error types
  ├── feature/
  │   ├── mod.rs          // Public interface + re-exports
  │   ├── operations.rs   // Low-level primitives
  │   ├── types.rs        // Feature-specific types
  │   └── impl.rs         // High-level implementation
```

### Pre-Submission Checklist

**Pre-Implementation (BEFORE writing code):**

- [ ] Searched for similar functionality (`grep -r "pattern" src/`)
- [ ] Read ALL files that would be affected (completely, not skimmed)
- [ ] Identified correct layer for new logic (ownership analysis)
- [ ] Verified no duplicate logic exists
- [ ] Questioned: "Does this component need to know this?"
- [ ] Applied Rule #0 to OWN design (not just user's request)

**Meta-Principle:**

- [ ] Design was critically evaluated (not yes-man accepted)

**Core Principles:**

- [ ] Each function has single responsibility (one job)
- [ ] Code is boring and obvious (not clever)
- [ ] Only code that's actually used exists (no future-proofing, no dead code)
- [ ] No duplicated knowledge (DRY - single source of truth)
- [ ] Every error has full context (self-documenting)

**Supporting Principles:**

- [ ] Components only know interfaces (minimal knowledge / loose coupling)

- [ ] Paths calculated from known roots (never assume)
- [ ] Setup completed before irreversible operations
- [ ] Preconditions validated early

**Guiding principles**:

- "Does this design actually make sense, or am I just agreeing?"
- "Is this the simplest thing that could possibly work?"
- "If I delete this, can I recreate it from git history?"

## How to Use These Rules

**❌ WRONG: Checklist after coding**

1. Write code
2. Check if it follows rules
3. Fix violations

**✅ RIGHT: Active thinking before coding**

1. Search for existing solutions (`grep -r "pattern" src/`)
2. Read affected files completely (don't skim)
3. Analyze ownership/layering ("Who should know this?")
4. Question necessity ("What breaks if I don't add this?")
5. THEN code (following rules)

**The rules are not a QA checklist—they're a design thinking framework.**
