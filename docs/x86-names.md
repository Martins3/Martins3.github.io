# x86's acronyms
1. x86 echnically x86 simply refers to a family of processors and the instruction set they all use. It actually  doesn't imply anything specific about data sizes.
2. IA-32 (short for "**Intel Architecture, 32-bit**", sometijmes also called **i386**)。
3. IA-64, so called Intel Itanium architecture, named `安腾` in Chinese，is already dead。
4. x86-64 (also known as **x64**, **x86_64**, **AMD64** and **Intel 64**)。

In certain context, `x86` means 32-bit version，`x64` means 64-bit version，jdk realease is [good example](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

Sometimes you may encounter `amd64`, is another name of `x86-64`，because AMD launch the 64-bit x86 earlier.
