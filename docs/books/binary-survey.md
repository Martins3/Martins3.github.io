# From hack to elaborate technique - A survey on binary rewriting
好吧，其实我大失所望，以后再看吧!

Our findings emphasize that although much work has been done over the last
decades, most of the effort was put into improvements aiming at rewriting general purpose applications, but
ignoring other challenges like altering *throughput-oriented programs*, or software with real-time requirements,
that are often used in the emerging field of the Internet of Things.

monitor the adherence to specification (e.g., Pebil [82]), or for reverse engineering of data structures (e.g, Howard [123])

Jennings and Poimboeuf [67]

like a high number of cache faults due to misalignment is of interest in high performance computing domains [86]

Specifically the insertion of stack canaries [41] or address layout randomization [133]. Additional exploit aversion techniques applied at run-time,
like attack recognition, also fall in this category (e.g., Zhang et al. [156])

will start an in-depth investigation of the identified building blocks.

Additionally, Larsen
et al. [79] conducted a survey on *automated software diversity approaches*, which when done
at post-compile or run-time utilize binary rewriting to apply security related augmentations to
software, such as adding stack canaries or implementing address layout randomization schemes.
