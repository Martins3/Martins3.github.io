# bloom filter

- https://github.com/ArashPartow/bloom : 看一个具体的例子，大致知道

- https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/map_bloom_filter.html

- multi generation LRU 中有使用过，在 mm/vmscan.c 中

```c
/*
 * Bloom filters with m=1<<15, k=2 and the false positive rates of ~1/5 when
 * n=10,000 and ~1/2 when n=20,000, where, conventionally, m is the number of
 * bits in a bitmap, k is the number of hash functions and n is the number of
 * inserted items.
 *
 * Page table walkers use one of the two filters to reduce their search space.
 * To get rid of non-leaf entries that no longer have enough leaf entries, the
 * aging uses the double-buffering technique to flip to the other filter each
 * time it produces a new generation. For non-leaf entries that have enough
 * leaf entries, the aging carries them over to the next generation in
 * walk_pmd_range(); the eviction also report them when walking the rmap
 * in lru_gen_look_around().
 *
 * For future optimizations:
 * 1. It's not necessary to keep both filters all the time. The spare one can be
 *    freed after the RCU grace period and reallocated if needed again.
 * 2. And when reallocating, it's worth scaling its size according to the number
 *    of inserted entries in the other filter, to reduce the memory overhead on
 *    small systems and false positives on large systems.
 * 3. Jenkins' hash function is an alternative to Knuth's.
