- [Superconductivity theory under attack](https://phys.org/news/2019-11-superconductivity-theory.html)

> The phenomenon was explained only in 1957, and in 1986, a new type of superconductivity was discovered in complex copper oxides. This high-temperature superconductivity even survives at balmy temperatures of 92 Kelvin.

- [Troubling Trends in Machine Learning Scholarship](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21669679)
> Recent progress in machine learning comes despite frequent departures from these ideals. 

> What's the root cause? Frankly I'd argue the majority of professors nowadays aren't smart in innovation but smart in hustling. Because hustlers are who become professors in today's academic climate. They are able to publish good papers still if the field isn't mature, but if the field is saturated, you have to be really smart to make meaningful progress, and these hustlers are not. So they just try to find some way to wrap meaningless progress in fancy math and shove it in papers. The papers also go to reviewers who are similar hustlers (not every paper can be reviewed by Hinton ) so they either don't notice the problem or they do but let it slide because it's just their colleague (yay for journals asking for "suggested reviewers" to the authors itself).


- [An effortless way to improve your memory](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21677794)

important, read it carefully !

> Just dim the lights, sit back, and enjoy 10-15 minutes of quiet contemplation, and you’ll find that your memory of the facts you have just learnt is far better than if you had attempted to use that moment more productively.

All these strategies have performance implications, and some also place restrictions on how your application in general can be designed.

## Entertainment
- [C-for-all](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21700197)
    - [c3](https://www.c3-lang.org/)
    - [D](https://dlang.org/)
    - [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)
    - [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/)

> If I wanted a direct C replacement with minimal improvements, I'd try D or Zig. If I wanted a systems programming language that had more differences but fewer surprises, Rust or Nim. The last thing I'd want is something that's both more baroque (rococo?) and less known than any of those.

- [The Magical Science of Wi-Fi on Airplanes](https://onezero.medium.com/what-makes-it-possible-to-browse-the-internet-at-35-000-feet-1afaea83eb5)

> Currently, airlines make $17 per passenger for services like inflight food and retail. Inflight Wi-Fi will add $4 to this ancillary revenue and is estimated to bring in $30 billion in additional revenue for airlines by 2035.

- [Comparison between macOS, Windows and Ubuntu](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=macos1015-win10-ubuntu&num=10)

> Of 86 benchmarks carried out across all three operating systems, Ubuntu 19.10 was the fastest 48% of the time followed by Windows 10 with leads 31% of the time and macOS 10.15 at just under 20%.

- [How do non green plants work ?](https://plantsandprejudice.wordpress.com/2013/08/07/how-do-non-green-plants-work/)

> So it seems that almost all land plants are green and if they are not then they have some chlorophyll hiding under their coloured exterior or they are stealing all their energy from another plant.

It's still impressing to acknowledge that  chlorophyll pigments is essential for photosynthesis.

- [Learning automation and manufacturing is more costly in terms of time and money](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21715018)

> A big problem in the US is that few people go into manufacturing engineering. It's a big thing in China, but not in the US. Average pay for manufacturing engineers is about $78K, according to Glassdoor. Senior level, maybe $82K. This is for a job which today requires understanding real-time computer control, electronics, mechanical engineering, and organizational behavior.

## Sentence
A few years ago, Intel threw its hands up in the air: couldn't increase GHz much
more without CPU temperatures reaching solar levels

To make this distinction clear, consider a reliable, connection-oriented
service, which is provided by many communication systems.

However, holy wars are being fought over whether RESTful services are
better than where services are specified by means of service-specific interfaces.

Event composition turns out to be a difficult task, notably
when the primitive events are generated from sources dispersed across the
distributed system

However, in light of the fact that the performance of context switching is generally dictated by ineffective use of memory caches, and not by the distinction
between the many-to-one or one-to-one threading model, many operating
systems now offer the latter model, if only for its simplicity.

I ditch google for duckduckgo

## Rethink
To strengthen the intimate relation, one of shortcuts is common hobbies.
But, never will I bend my knees to these tricks. The baseline is clear, no contempt and no lies to myself. Respect for both sides.
If she can't bear slight differences in the interests, and can't appreciate my dependent personality. OK, let's break up. I won't change myself into a password cracker.
