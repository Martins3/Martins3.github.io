- [coolest things I learned in 2019](https://www.perell.com/blog/2019/12/11/coolest-things-i-learned-in-2019)

This a bunch of fascinating ideas. I choose some of them which touches me most.

> One of the best pieces of advice I ever got, back when I was 23 and newly out of school, is this: look around and figure out who you want to be on your team. Figure out the people around you that you want to work with for the rest of your life. Figure out the people who are smart & awesome, who share your values, who get things done — and maybe most important, who you like to be with and who you want to help win. And treat them right, always. Look for ways to help, to work together, to learn. Because in 20 years you’ll all be in amazing places doing amazing things.

It's not what you do, but who you work with that matters. What you are doing determines the your colleges, so qualify yourself and choose carefully.

> Writing is the most scalable professional networking activity - stay home, don't go to events/conferences, and just put ideas down. 

Writing shaped my personality and salvaged me from absent mind, week power will and low expectations of future. Now, writing has another important function, forming my ideas and spread them.
In a restless society teemed with all kinds of persuasions with unknown purposes, we need a clear and firm mind to shield ourselves.

> The two partners get the benefits of time together and time alone, which helps the marriage.

Love can't sustain without strategies dealing with humans' internal shortcoming. We like who alike us. We like who surround us.

> Small increases in productivity have a huge long-term impact.

This is the reason why I love Vim. 

> It has always appalled me that really bright scientists almost all work in the most competitive fields, the ones in which they are making the least difference. In other words, if they were hit by a truck, the same discovery would be made by somebody else about 10 minutes later.

> Against the Majority
> 1. “The majority is always wrong. The minority is rarely right.” — Henrik Ibsen
> 2. “If everybody is thinking alike, then no one is thinking.” — Benjamin Franklin

> At critical moments in time, you can raise the aspirations of other people significantly, especially when they are relatively young, simply by suggesting they do something better or more ambitious than what they might have in mind. It costs you relatively little to do this, but the benefit to them, and to the broader world, may be enormous. This is in fact one of the most valuable things you can do with your time and with your life.

We have already limited by our ambition and are suffering the catastrophic consequences.
Never limit our goals to normal guy as someone described, a house, a wife/husband, two children and a decent job.
What is my ambition, change the world.

> The video game industry generates more revenue than movies and music.

What's art ? And what's industry ? Propaganda machine ?

> A 90s study showed that women preferred the scents of men whose immune systems were most different from their own immune-system genes. 

That's interesting!

> One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations. Once people get used to a certain luxury, they take it for granted. Then they begin to count on it. Finally they reach a point where they can’t live without it.
