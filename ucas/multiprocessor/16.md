# Futures, Scheduling, and Work Distribution

## 16.1 Introduction
In this chapter, however, we look at applications that have
inherent parallelism, but where it is not obvious how to take advantage of it

> 然后讲解了一个矩阵相乘的例子。

方案A : 对于每一个矩阵创建一个thread
A more effective way to organize such a program is to create a pool of long-lived threads. Each thread in the pool repeatedly waits until it is assigned a task,
a short-lived unit of computation.

In Java, a thread pool is called an executor service (interface java.util.Executor Service).
It provides the ability to submit a task, the ability to wait for a set
of submitted tasks to complete, and the ability to cancel uncompleted tasks.

> 一般来说，Runable 和 Executor 使用，callable 和 future 联合使用。

The matrix example uses futures only to signal when a task is complete.
Futures can also be used to pass values from completed tasks.

## 16.2 Analyzing Parallelism
计算递推公式，分析最大加速比。

## 16.3 Realistic Multiprocessor Scheduling
process average : 计算过程中间，平均可以使用的

Critical path length : The other extreme is also of special importance: T∞, *the number of steps to execute the program on an unlimited number of processors*, is called the critical-path length
> 表示不同并行度下可以执行的步数 T1表示只能串行执行的 T∞ 可以无限多线程同时执行的函数

Theorem 16.3.1 表达的内容，关注点在于P 和 PA 分别表示的差值，其中PA 表示执行平均使用的 core 的数量。
证明的方法，利用token 的数量，对于每一个step 正在执行的工作的和只是idle 各自一个 token，关键的位置在于计算 idle token 的数量，处于idle 对多是 P - 1 对于DAG最长的路径分析中间，认为总是有人处于空闲。

## 16.4 Work Distribution
We now understand that the key to achieving a good speedup is to keep
user-level threads supplied with tasks, so that the resulting schedule is as greedy
as possible. Multithreaded computations, however, create and destroy tasks
dynamically, sometimes in unpredictable ways. A work distribution algorithm is
needed to *assign ready tasks* to idle threads as efficiently as possible.

Instead, we first consider
work stealing, in which a thread that runs out of work tries to “steal” work from
others.
> 有点像 epidemic 中间的push 和 pull

#### 16.4.1 Work Stealing

#### 16.4.2 Yielding and Multiprogramming
As noted earlier, multiprocessors provide a **three-level** model of computation:
short-lived tasks are executed by system-level threads, which are scheduled
by the operating system on a fixed number of processors.

> 为什么我们需要 yield ?

To guarantee progress, we must ensure that
threads that have work to do are not unreasonably delayed by (thief ) threads
which are idle except for task-stealing. To prevent this situation, we have each
thief call Thread.yield() immediately before trying to steal a task

> 当没有工作需要完成的时候，首先yield 让其他有工作的开始工作，而不是将别人的工作抢过来。

## 16.5 Work-Stealing Dequeu

#### 16.5.1 A Bounded Work-Stealing Dequeue

Suppose thread A tries to steal a task from index 3.
A reads a reference to the task at that position, and tries to steal it by calling
compareAndSet() to set the index to 4. It is delayed before making the call, and
in the meantime, thread B removes all the tasks and inserts three new tasks.
When A awakens, its compareAndSet() call will succeed in changing the index
from 3 to 4, but it will have stolen a task that has already been completed,
and removed a task that will never be completed. The stamp ensures that A’s
compareAndSet() call will fail because the stamps no longer match.
> 其实CAS的本来问题，popTop 使用其中的序号而已，top 变量只是一个简单的数值，
> 其实这只是标号的问题，道理是清晰的

```java
popTop() // 方法 : 只要预先申请，利用CAS来确定是否存在该结果。盗窃者，多个人。
// 如何防止出现其中，虽然top的数值总是增加，但是可能获取了数值，然后数值被清空，然后被装入新的数值
// top 的数值被重新进入了

popBottom() // 需要处理防止越界的事情，所以和top 比较一下
pushBottom() // 和Bottom 相关的操作都是自己完成的，所以bottom 没有任何特别的处理。
```

#### 16.5.2 An Unbounded Work-Stealing DEQueue
> 上面的事项中间，top 只会增加

To address these limitations, we now consider an unbounded double-ended
queue UnboundedDEQueue class that dynamically resizes itself as needed。

with one key
difference: the use of modular arithmetic to compute indexes means the top
index need never be decremented. As noted, there is no need for a timestamp to
prevent ABA problems.

## 16.5.3 Work Balancing
An alternative approach is to have each thread periodically balance its workloads with a randomly chosen partner.
