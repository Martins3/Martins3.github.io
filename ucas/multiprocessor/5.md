# 5 The Relative Power of Primitive Synchronization Operations
Imagine you are in charge of designing a new multiprocessor. What kinds of atomic instructions should you include?
> 似乎解释一个关键问题 !

To this end, we need some way to evaluate the power of various
synchronization primitives: what synchronization problems they can solve, and
how efficiently they can solve them

The basic idea is simple: each class in the hierarchy has an associated consensus number, which is the maximum number of threads for which objects of the
class can solve an elementary synchronization problem called consensus.

*We will see that in a system of n or more concurrent threads, it is impossible to construct
a wait-free or lock-free implementation of an object with consensus number n
from an object with a lower consensus number.*

## 5.1 Consensus Numbers
The object’s decide() method will return a value meeting the following conditions:
1. consistent: all threads decide the same value.
2. valid: the common decision value is some thread’s input.
> 所有thread 从他们的input 中间决定相同的 thread 输入，so what !

Sometimes it is useful to focus on consensus problems where all inputs are
either zero or one. We call this specialized problem binary consensus. To simplify
the presentation, we focus here on binary consensus, but our claims apply verbatim to consensus in general

We will restrict ourselves to object classes with deterministic sequential speci-
fications (i.e., ones in which each sequential method call has a single outcome).

Definition 5.1.1. A class C solves n-thread consensus if there exist a consensus
protocol using any number of objects of class C and any number of atomic
registers.

Definition 5.1.2. The consensus number of a class C is the largest n for which
that class solves n-thread consensus. If no largest n exists, we say the consensus
number of the class is infinite.

Corollary 5.1.1. Suppose one can implement an object of class C from one or
more objects of class D, together with some number of **atomic registers**. If class
C solves n-consensus, then so does class D

#### 5.1.1 States and Valence
The reader will notice that
since the decide() method of a given consensus object is executed **only once** by
each thread, and there are a finite number of threads, by definition a lock-free
implementation would also be wait-free and vice versa.

Here, a *move* is a method call to a shared object.

A protocol *state* consists of the states of the threads and the shared objects.

A wait-free protocol’s set of possible states forms a tree, where each node represents a possible protocol state, and each *edge* represents a possible move by
some thread

Lemma 5.1.1. Every 2-thread consensus protocol has a bivalent initial state.
> 证明无法，显然我们做出一个图形来，thread A 和 thread B 同时移动到一个位置，毕竟move 只是普通的函数调用
> 从证明方法，我感觉move特指 decide() 操作


A protocol state is critical if:
- It is bivalent, and
- if any thread moves, the protocol state becomes univalent.

Lemma 5.1.3. Every wait-free consensus protocol has a critical state
> 反证法

## 5.2 Atomic Registers
The obvious place to begin is to ask whether we can solve consensus using atomic
registers. Surprisingly, perhaps, the answer is no. We will show that there is no
*binary consensus protocol* for two threads.
> atomic register ?

Theorem 5.2.1. Atomic registers have consensus number 1
1. 首先进入到 critical region，下一个move，如果A 进入0 B 进入1
2. What methods could A and B be about to call? We now consider an exhaustive list of
the possibilities: one of them reads from a register, they both write to separate
registers, or they both write to the same register. (让人迷惑，这些分类是什么含义 ? 为什么需要读写寄存器 ?)
3. B must decide the same value in both scenarios, a contradiction.


The problem is that *both scenarios lead to indistinguishable protocol states.*
*Neither A nor B can tell which move was first.* The resulting state is therefore
both 0-valent and 1-valent, a contradiction.

> atomic register 其实就是load store 然后overlap的动作，而且没有绑定read write 的。

**The aforementioned corollary is perhaps one of the most striking impossibility results in Computer Science. It explains why, if we want to implement lockfree concurrent data structures on modern multiprocessors, our hardware must
provide primitive synchronization operations other than loads and stores (reads–writes).**

## 5.3 Consensus Protocols
The object has an **array of atomic registers** in which each
`decide()` method proposes its input value and then goes on to execute a sequence
of steps in order to decide on one of the proposed values. We will devise different
implementations of the decide() method using various synchronization objects.

```java
public abstract class ConsensusProtocol<T> implements Consensus<T> {
  protected T[] proposed = (T[]) new Object[N];
  // announce my input value to the other threads
  void propose(T value) {
    proposed[ThreadID.get()] = value;
  }
  // figure out which thread was first
  abstract public T decide(T value);
}
```

> 通过 propose 提交各个线程的输入，但是decide决定其中的一个value
> @todo 所以，T 的取值是什么 ? (array of atomic register 中间装的是 T, 所以怀疑 T 的取值任意)

## 5.4 FIFO Queue
> 本section 分析为什么two-dequeuer FIFO 的 consensus 就是 2

In Chapter 3, we saw a wait-free FIFO queue implementation using only atomic
registers, subject to the limitation that **only one thread could enqueue to the
queue, and only one thread could dequeue from the queue.** It is natural to ask
whether one can provide a wait-free implementation of a FIFO queue that supports multiple enqueuers and dequeuers. For now, let us focus on a more specific
problem: can we provide a wait-free implementation of a two-dequeuer FIFO
queue using atomic registers?
> の，chapter 3 只是使用 FIFO queue 举了一个例子，说明一下不加锁的好处以及分析lock-free/wait-free问题的困难，
> 所以，虽然是 atomic 实现的，但是，single-enqueuer/single-dequeuer FIFO queue 的限制。

Theorem 5.4.1. The two-dequeuer FIFO queue class has consensus number at least 2.

> In particular, if one thread is suspended, then a lock-free algorithm guarantees that the remaining threads can still make progress.
> Lock-freedom allows individual threads to starve but guarantees system-wide throughput. An algorithm is lock-free if, when the program threads are run for a sufficiently long time, at least one of the threads makes progress (for some sensible definition of progress). All wait-free algorithms are lock-free.

## 5.5 Multiple Assignment Object
This problem is the dual of the atomic snapshot object (Chapter 4),
where we assign to one field and read multiple fields atomically.
> 此处 : read one , write multiple

Theorem 5.5.1. There is no wait-free implementation of an (m, n)-assignment
object by atomic registers for any n > m > 1.
> 证明方法: 说明其 consensus number 至少为2 采用构造的方法，构造方法类似于二进制编码，无论是谁先后

Theorem 5.5.2. Atomic (n, n(n+1) / 2)-register assignment for n > 1 has consensus number at least n
> 其实是刚才例子类似的构造。

> 并没有解释其上限是多少。
## 5.6 Read–Modify–Write Operations
Many, if not all, of the classical synchronization operations provided by multiprocessors in hardware can be expressed as read–modify–write (RMW) operations,
or, as they are called in their object form, read–modify–write registers.

An RMW method is nontrivial if *its set of functions includes at least one function* that is not the identity function.

Theorem 5.6.1. Any nontrivial RMW register has consensus number at least 2
> 证明方法，实现一个consensus prototol 来说明。

> 1. decide 函数中间是持有 propose 的，这就是在构造wait-free universal 的时候，从来没有看到 propose
> 2. 但是需要注意解释，decide 函数似乎是一次性的，或者说，consensus 对象对于每个thread 来说，只能使用一次。
> 3. 因为是证明其中的 consensus number 为２，所以 thread 数目就是只有两个的


## 5.7 Common2 RMW Operations
Very informally, here is why RMW registers in Common2 cannot solve 3-thread consensus.
The first thread (the winner) can always tell it was first, and
each of the second and third threads (the losers) can each tell that they were losers.
However, because the functions defining the state following operations in **Common2 commute or overwrite**,
*a loser thread cannot tell which of the others went first (was the winner)*,
and because the protocol is wait-free, it cannot wait to find out. Let us make this argument more precise.
> 其实，这一个调用是在说，连续的两次调用 A B 各自分别进行一次调用，对于C来说，好像就是一样的

Theorem 5.7.1. Any RMW register in Common2 has consensus number (exactly) 2
> probe

The kind of reasoning used in the proof of *Theorem 5.2.1* shows that the pending methods
cannot be reads or writes, nor can the threads be about to call methods of different objects.
It follows that the threads are about to call RMW methods of a single register `r`.
> 导致从 multivalent 进入 univalent 在 critical region 上的操作不可能是 read write 和 call

## 5.8 The compareAndSet() Operation


## 补充资料
- [why test-and-set's consensus number is 2](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/33031/why-is-the-consensus-number-for-test-and-set-2)

> 问题是什么叫做观察起来，看起来相同!
> 或者说，C 不知道 A 看上去有没有执行过.
> 执行过和共识有什么关系吗 ?
> 其中的 move 包括 test and set 吗 ? (应该是)


使用原子操作，让操作的顺序可以确定。
虽然A B 打成了共识，但是 C 确没有达成，因为TAS(test and set) 操作对于C 不可知。
consensus 的数值不能决定调度的线程的数目，所以 consensus number 到底意味着什么东西 ?

只是说，无法实现wait-free的，但是如果不保证 wait-free，程序还是可以继续进行的!

the test-and-set instruction is an instruction used to write 1 (set) to a memory location and return its old value as a single atomic (i.e., non-interruptible) operation
```c
void Lock(boolean *lock) {
    while (test_and_set(lock) == 1);
}
```

CompareAndSet : 比较两个数值，如果相等，那么设置，否则返回。
