You will also learn a bit about how PCI handles some nifty kernel features such as
probing and power management.


For an in-depth discussion of PCI, such as device
driver design, PCI bus features, and implementation details, refer to Linux Device
Drivers and *Understanding the Linux Kernel*, as well as PCI specifications.
> 什么，*Understanding the Linux Kernel* 中间 讲过 pci

`pci_device_id`
Device identifier. This is not a local ID used by Linux, but an ID defined accordingly to the PCI standard.

`pci_dev`
Each PCI device is assigned a pci_dev instance, just as network devices are
assigned net_device instances. This is the structure used by the kernel to refer to
a PCI device.

`pci_driver`
Defines the interface between the PCI layer and the device drivers. This structure consists mostly of function pointers. All PCI devices use it.

PCI devices are uniquely identified by a combination of parameters, including vendor, model, etc.

Each device driver registers with the kernel a vector of pci_device_id instances that
lists the IDs of the devices it can handle.

PCI device drivers register and unregister with the kernel with pci_register_driver
and pci_unregister_driver, respectively.

**One of the great advantages of PCI is its elegant support for probing to find the IRQ
and other resources each device needs.**

> The Big Picture 的这一节可以细品

想法: pci 是基础架构，pci 的三层 (事务，路由，物理)内核并不会参与，
但是，哪一个设备 和 对应的驱动关联 (nvme) 
资源的分配
需要 pci driver 处理，一旦这些搞定之后，pci driver 就可以退居幕后了
