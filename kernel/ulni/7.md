This infrastructure is worth studying to help you understand how core
components of the networking stack are initialized, including NIC device drivers.

The purpose of this chapter is to show how the kernel handles routines used to initialize kernel components, both for components statically included into the kernel
and those loaded as kernel modules, with a special emphasis on network devices. We
will therefore see:
• How initialization functions are named and identified by special macros
• How these macros are defined, based on the kernel configuration, to optimize
memory usage and make sure that the various initializations are done in the correct order
• When and how the functions are executed

`parse_args` is a routine that parses an input string with parameters in the form `name_variable=value`, looking for specific keywords and invoking the right handlers. `parse_args` is also used when loading a module, to parse the command-line parameters provided (if any).

When a piece of code is compiled as a module, the `__setup` macro is ignored (i.e.,
defined as a no-op).

The reason why start_kernel calls `parse_args` twice to parse the boot configuration
string is that boot-time options are actually divided into two classes, and each call
takes care of one class:

`early_param` 和 `__setup` 被分别分析

Some options need to be handled earlier than others during the kernel boot. The
kernel provides the early_param macro to declare these options instead of `__setup`.
