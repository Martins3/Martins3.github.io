 In this first chapter, we will cover:
• A piece of the core networking code initialization.
• The initialization of an NIC.
• How an NIC uses interrupts, and how IRQ handlers can be allocated and
released. We will also look at how drivers can share IRQs.
• How the user can provide configuration parameters to device drivers loaded as
modules.
• Interaction between user space and kernel during device initialization and configuration. We will look at how the kernel can run a user-space helper to either
load the correct device driver for an NIC or apply a user-space configuration. In
particular, we will look at the Hotplug feature.
• **How virtual devices differ from real ones with regard to configuration and interaction with the kernel.**

Before start_kernel terminates, it invokes
the init kernel thread, which takes care of the rest of the initializations. Most of the
initialization activities related to this chapter happen to be inside do_basic_setup.

run_init_process determines the first process run on the system, the parent of all
other processes; it has a PID of 1 and never halts until the system is done. Normally
the program run is init, part of the SysVinit package.

The kernel provides two kinds of macros to define options:
- Module options (macros of the module_param family)

  These define options you can provide when you load a module. When a component is built into the kernel, you cannot provide values for these options at kernel boot time. However, with the introduction of the /sys filesystem, you can
  configure the options via those files at runtime. The /sys interface is relatively
  new, compared to the /proc interface. The later section “Module Options” goes
  into a little more detail on these options.

- Boot-time kernel options (macros of the `__setup` family)

These define options you can provide at boot time with a boot loader.

An important part of initialization for the networking code, including Traffic Control and per-CPU ingress queues, is performed at boot time by `net_dev_init`

kmod is the kernel module loader that allows kernel components to request the loading of a module. The kernel provides more than one routine, but here we’ll look only
at `request_module`

Hotplug was introduced into the Linux kernel to implement the popular consumer
feature known as Plug and Play (PnP). This feature allows the kernel to detect the
insertion or removal of hot-pluggable devices and to notify a user-space application,
giving the latter enough details to make it able to load the associated driver if needed,
and to apply the associated configuration if one is present.

Linux allows you to define different kinds o virtual devices. Here are a few examples:
Bonding, 802.1Q , Briding,  Aliasing interface, True equalizer (TEQL), Tunnel interfaces


Virtual devices and real devices interact with the kernel in slightly different ways. For
example, they differ with regard to the following points:
1. initialization
2. .....

For some of
these data structures, a user-space command is provided to print their contents in a
more user-friendly format. For example, lsmod lists the modules currently loaded,
using /proc/modules as its source of information.

In /proc/sys/kernel are the files modprobe and hotplug that can change the pathnames

In /proc/net, you can find the files created by net_dev_init, via dev_proc_init and
dev_mcast_init (see the earlier section “Initializing the Device Handling Layer: net_
dev_init”):
