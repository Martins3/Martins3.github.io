# 3 System Resources
The operating system manages the software-execution environment and general system operation
through the use of system resources. These resources consist of
1. system registers (control registers and
model-specific registers) and
2. system-data structures (memory-management and protection tables).
The system-control registers are described in detail in this chapter; many of the features they control
are described elsewhere in this volume

Because of their complexity, system-data structures are described in separate chapters. Refer to the
following chapters for detailed information on these data structures:
1. Descriptors and descriptor tables are described in “Segmentation Data Structures and Registers”
on page 67.
2. Page-translation tables are described in “Legacy-Mode Page Translation” on page 122 and “Long Mode Page Translation” on page 130.
3. The task-state segment is described in “Legacy Task-State Segment” on page 335 and “64-Bit Task
State Segment” on page 339.

> 主要介绍各种cr 寄存器和 RFLAGS, 以及 EFER

## 3.2 Model-Specific Registers (MSRs)
Processor implementations provide model-specific registers (MSRs) for software control over the
unique features supported by that implementation. Software reads and writes MSRs using the
privileged **RDMSR** and **WRMSR** instructions. Implementations of the AMD64 architecture can
contain a mixture of two basic MSR types:

The AMD64 architecture includes a number of features that are controlled using MSRs. Those MSRs
are shown in Figure 3-9. The EFER register—described in “Extended Feature Enable Register
(EFER)” on page 55—is also an MSR.

    - SYSENTERx Registers -> 给 syscall 和 sysexit 使用的
    - KernelGSbase Register -> swapgs ???
    - FS.base and GS.base Registers. These registers allow 64-bit base-address values to be specified
for the FS and GS segments, for use in 64-bit mode. See “FS and GS Registers in 64-Bit Mode” on
page 72 for a description of the special treatment the FS and GS segments receive

# 4 Segmented Virtual Memory

The segmentation mechanism provides ten segment registers, each of which defines a single segment.
Six of these registers (CS, DS, ES, FS, GS, and SS) define user segments. User segments hold
software, data, and the stack and can be used by both application software and system software. The
remaining four segment registers (GDT, LDT, IDT, and TR) define system segments. System
segments contain data structures initialized and used only by system software.
> 谁还在使用 ? 谁的作用发生了改变 ?

Although segmentation provides a great deal of flexibility in relocating and protecting software and
data, it is often more efficient to handle memory isolation and relocation with a combination of
software and hardware paging support. For this reason, most modern system software bypasses the
segmentation features. However, segmentation cannot be completely disabled, and an understanding
of the segmentation mechanism is important to implementing long-mode system software

In long mode, the effects of segmentation depend on whether the processor is running in compatibility
mode or 64-bit mode:
1. In compatibility mode, segmentation functions just as it does in legacy mode, using legacy 16-bit
or 32-bit protected mode semantics.
2. 64-bit mode, segmentation is disabled, creating a flat 64-bit virtual-address space. As will be seen,
certain functions of some segment registers, particularly the system-segment registers, continue to
be used in 64-bit mode.
> 那么，如何确定当前是在兼容模式还是64-bit mode 的

## 4.1 Real Mode Segmentation
If the interrupt descriptor table (IDT) is used to find the real mode IDT see “Real-Mode Interrupt
Control Transfers” on page 238.

The GDT, LDT, and TSS (see below) are not used in real mode.

## 4.2 Virtual-8086 Mode Segmentation
System software can use the segmentation mechanism to support one of two basic segmented-memory
models: a flat-memory model or a multi-segmented model. These segmentation models are supported
in legacy mode and in compatibility mode. Each type of model is described in the following sections.

## 4.3 Protected Mode Segmented-Memory Models
In the multi-segmented memory model, each segment register can reference a unique base address
with a unique segment size. Segments can be as small as a single byte or as large as 4 Gbytes. *When
page translation is used, multiple segments can be mapped to a single page and multiple pages can be
mapped to a single segment.*
> segment 和 page 混用，如何实现，而且segment 和 page 互相映射是怎么

4.3.3 Segmentation in 64-Bit Mode
In 64-bit mode, segmentation is disabled. The segment-base value is ignored and treated as 0 by the
segmentation hardware. Likewise, segment limits and most attributes are ignored. There are a few
exceptions. The CS-segment DPL, D, and L attributes are used (respectively) to establish the privilege
level for a program, the default operand size, and whether the program is running in 64-bit mode or
compatibility mode.
> @todo CS 尾端的RPL 的作用是什么 ? 和 DPL 到底如何协作的 ?
> @todo 每一个进程都是需要一个Code Segment descriptor 其实是一个错误的想法，我怀疑，那就是其实在 compatible 中间其实依旧只有两个 idt 的



The FS and GS segments can be used as additional base registers in address
calculations, and those segments can have non-zero base-address values. This facilitates addressing
thread-local data and certain system-software data structures. See “FS and GS Registers in 64-Bit
Mode” on page 72 for details about the FS and GS segments in 64-bit mode. The system-segment
registers are always used in 64-bit mode
> @todo 应该也是没有什么需要阅读的，只是不在作为 gdt selector 了，而是当作 per thread base address 而已，实现并不复杂
> @todo 如果是percpu， perthread 变量分别如何实现的


## 4.4 Segmentation Data Structures and Registers


## 4.5 Segment Selectors and Registers
**CS Register**. The CS register contains the segment selector referencing the current code-segment
descriptor entry. All instruction fetches reference the CS descriptor. When a new selector is loaded into
the CS register, *the current-privilege level (CPL) of the processor is set to that of the CS-segment
descriptor-privilege level (DPL)*.
> CPL 会放到CS 上，同时也会放到 descriptor 的 DPL

**CS Register in 64-Bit Mode**. In 64-bit mode, most of the hidden portion of the CS register is
ignored. Only the L (long), D (default operation size), and DPL (descriptor privilege-level) attributes
are recognized by 64-bit mode. Address calculations assume a CS.base value of 0. CS references do
not check the CS.limit value, but instead check that the effective address is in canonical form


**Requestor Privilege-Level (RPL) Field**. Bits 1:0. The RPL represents the privilege level (CPL) the
processor is operating under at the time the selector is created.
RPL is used in segment privilege-checks to prevent software running at lesser privilege levels from
accessing privileged data. *See “Data-Access Privilege Checks” on page 97 and “Control-Transfer
Privilege Checks” on page 100 for more information on segment privilege-checks.*
> @todo 更加疑惑了，所以 code segment descriptor 中间的DPL 的作用是什么啊 ?


**Null Selector**. Null selectors have a selector index of 0 and TI=0, corresponding to the first entry in
the GDT. However, null selectors do not reference the first GDT entry but are instead used to
**invalidate unused segment registers**. A general-protection exception (#GP) occurs if a reference is
made to use a segment register containing a null selector in non-64-bit mode. By initializing unused
segment registers with null selectors software can trap references to unused segments.
**Null selectors can only be loaded into the DS, ES, FS and GS data-segment registers, and into the
LDTR descriptor-table register**. A #GP occurs if software attempts to load the CS register with a null
selector or if software attempts to load the SS register with a null selector in non 64-bit mode or at CPL
3.
> @todo 查找null segment selector， 到底为什么设置哪一个东西，就是为了实现 disable segment 吗 ? invalidate unused segment register

The complete
EA calculation then becomes (FS or GS).base + base + (scale ∗ index) + displacement. The `FS.base`
and `GS.base` values are also expanded to the full 64-bit virtual-address size, as shown in Figure 4-5.
> 修改GS.base 和 FS.base 一共含有两种方法




## 4.6 Descriptor Tables

Protected-mode system software must create a global descriptor table (GDT).
The GDT contains codesegment and data-segment descriptor entries (user segments) for segments that can be shared by all
tasks.
In addition to the user segments, the GDT can also hold gate descriptors and other system segment descriptors. System software can store the GDT anywhere in memory and should protect the
segment containing the GDT from non-privileged software.
> 如果gdt 中间持有所有的task 共享的segment , 那么为什么可以持有user segment 啊 ?


Protected-mode system software can optionally create a local descriptor table (LDT) to hold segment
descriptors belonging to a single task or even multiple task
> 可选，一个甚至多个 ?

The LDT typically contains code-segment and data-segment descriptors as well as gate descriptors referenced by the specified task
> 原来三者是平行关系，分析处理code data 和 gate(各种入口，比如各种中断入口之类的)

Segment selectors point to the LDT when the table-index bit (TI) in the selector is set to 1. The selector
index portion of the segment selector references a specific entry in the LDT
> @todo

> Segment selector 是什么 ?
> Segment selector 不是 segment register
>  The CS register contains the segment selector referencing the current code-segment descriptor entry
> @todo 所以 segment selector 没有加载到cs 中间的时候存放在什么位置，如何加载到其中的

The LDTR has two portions. A visible portion holds the LDT selector,
and a hidden portion holds the LDT descriptor. When the LDT selector is loaded into the LDTR, the
processor automatically loads the LDT descriptor from the GDT into the hidden portion of the LDTR.
> load the LDT descriptor from the GDT, 说明ldt descriptor 的确是存储在gdt 中间的，而且 ldt descriptor 再次指向不同的 ldt
> @todo 所以ldt 中间存储的东西是什么 ?

The IDT can contain only the following types of gate descriptors:
- Interrupt gates
- Trap gates
- Task gates
> @todo 原来这些gate是放到idt 中间的，所以gdt 和 ldt 中间放置什么东西






## 4.8 Long-Mode Segment Descriptors
Code segments continue to exist in long mode. Code segments and their associated descriptors and
selectors are needed to establish the processor operating mode as well as execution privilege-level.
> CS 可以确定当前运行 compatibility mode or 64-bit mode

In Figure 4-20, gray shading indicates the code-segment descriptor fields that are ignored in 64-bit
mode when the descriptor is used during a memory reference.
![4-20](./img/2-4-20.png)

> @todo 我想知道，虽然CS Descriptor 中间的内容几乎全部清空了，但是依旧持有DPL， 那么 selector 中间的RPL 和 user_mode 如何解释啊 ?

In data-segment descriptors referenced by the DS, ES and SS segment registers, the base-address
field is ignored. For the purpose of virtual-address calculations, the base address is treated as if it
has a value of zero.

Data segments referenced by the FS and GS segment registers receive special treatment in 64-bit
mode. *For these segments, the base address field is not ignored, and a non-zero value can be used
in virtual-address calculations*. A 64-bit segment-base address can be specified using model pecific registers. See “FS and GS Registers in 64-Bit Mode” on page 72 for more information.
> data segment 应该是只对于 FS GS 有意义
> @todo data segment descriptor 和 code segment descriptor 出现在同一个位置吗 ?

A data-segment-descriptor DPL field is ignored in 64-bit mode, and segment-privilege checks are not
performed on data segments. System software can use the page-protection mechanisms to isolate and
protect data from unauthorized access.

## 4.9 Segment-Protection Overview
Segment-level protection remains enabled in compatibility mode. 64-bit mode eliminates most type
checking, and limit checking is not performed, except on accesses to *system-descriptor tables*.

The preferred method of implementing memory protection in a long-mode operating system is to rely
on the page-protection mechanism as described in *“Page-Protection Checks” on page 145*. *System
software still needs to create basic segment-protection data structures for 64-bit mode*. These
structures are simplified, however, by the use of the flat-memory model in 64-bit mode, and the **limited
segmentation checks** performed when executing in 64-bit mode.


## 4.11 Control-Transfer Privilege Checks
The `rIP` register is updated
with the target CS offset taken from either the far-pointer operand or the gate descriptor. Privilege
checks are not performed during near control transfers because such transfers do not change
segments.
The following mechanisms can be used by software to perform far control transfers:
1. System-software control transfers using the system-call and system-return instructions. See
“SYSCALL and SYSRET” on page 152 and “SYSENTER and SYSEXIT (Legacy Mode Only)”
on page 154 for more information on these instructions. SYSCALL and SYSRET are the preferred
method of performing control transfers in long mode. SYSENTER and SYSEXIT are not supported
in long mode.
2. Direct control transfers using CALL and JMP instructions. These are discussed in the next section,
“Direct Control Transfers.”
3. Call-gate control transfers using CALL and JMP instructions. These are discussed in “Control
Transfers Through Call Gates” on page 104.
4. Return control transfers using the RET instruction. These are discussed in “Return Control
Transfers” on page 111.
5. Interrupts and exceptions, including the INTn and IRET instructions. These are discussed in
Chapter 8, “Exceptions and Interrupts.”
6. Task switches initiated by CALL and JMP instructions. Task switches are discussed in Chapter 12,
“Task Management.” The hardware task-switch mechanism is not supported in long mode.

# 8 Exceptions and Interrupts
Throughout this section, the term masking can refer to either disabling or delaying an interrupt. For
example, masking external interrupts delays the interrupt, with the processor holding the interrupt as
pending until it is unmasked.
> @todo 被masked interrupt 被存储在什么位置 ?


## 8.1 General Characteristics
precise exception

instruction restart

types of exception : faults, traps and aborts


## 8.3 Exceptions During a Task Switch
In long mode, an exception cannot occur during a task switch, because the hardware task-switch
mechanism is disabled.

## 8.4 Error Codes
 The error code has two formats: a selector
format for most error-reporting exceptions, and a page-fault format for page faults


## 8.9 Long-Mode Interrupt Control Transfers
The long-mode architecture expands the legacy interrupt-mechanism to support 64-bit operating
systems and applications. These changes include:
- All interrupt handlers are 64-bit code and operate in 64-bit mode.
- The size of an interrupt-stack push is fixed at 64 bits (8 bytes).
- The interrupt-stack frame is aligned on a 16-byte boundary.
- The stack pointer, SS:RSP, is pushed unconditionally on interrupts, rather than conditionally based on a change in CPL.
- The SS selector register is loaded with a null selector as a result of an interrupt, if the CPL changes.
- The IRET instruction behavior changes, to unconditionally pop SS:RSP, allowing a null SS to be popped.
- A new interrupt stack-switch mechanism, called the interrupt-stack table or IST, is introduced.
> SS 还是含有作用的啊!

When an interrupt occurs in long mode, the processor multiplies the interrupt vector number by 16 and
uses the result as an offset into the IDT. The gate descriptor referenced by the IDT offset contains a
segment-selector and a 64-bit segment-offset field. The gate-descriptor segment-offset field contains
the complete virtual address for the interrupt handler. The gate-descriptor segment-selector field
points to the target code-segment descriptor located in either the GDT or LDT. The code-segment
descriptor is only **used for privilege-checking purposes** and for placing the processor in 64-bit mode.
The code segment-descriptor base field, limit field, and most attributes are ignored

In long mode, the return-program stack pointer (SS:RSP) is always pushed onto the interrupt-handler
stack, regardless of whether or not a privilege change occurs. Although the SS register is not used in
64-bit mode, SS is pushed to allow returns into compatibility mode. Pushing SS:RSP unconditionally
presents operating systems with a consistent interrupt-stack-frame size for all interrupts, except for
error codes. Interrupt service-routine entry points that handle interrupts generated by non-error-code
interrupts can push an error code on the stack for consistency
> `SS` 只是为了兼容

In long mode, when a control transfer to an interrupt handler occurs, the processor performs the
following:
1. Aligns the new interrupt-stack frame by masking RSP with FFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFF0h.
2. *If IST field in interrupt gate is not 0, reads IST pointer into RSP*. @todo interrupt gate ?
3. If a privilege change occurs, the target DPL is used as an index into the long-mode TSS to select a new stack pointer (RSP).
4. If a privilege change occurs, *SS is cleared to zero indicating a null selector.* @todo 难道null selector 不是一直都是 zero 的吗 ?
5. Pushes the return stack pointer (old SS:RSP) onto the new stack. The SS value is padded with six bytes to form a quadword.
6. Pushes the 64-bit RFLAGS register onto the stack. The upper 32 bits of the RFLAGS image on the stack are written as zeros.
7. Clears the TF, NT, and RF bits in RFLAGS bits to 0.
8. Handles the RFLAGS.IF bit according to the gate-descriptor type:
    - If the gate descriptor is an interrupt gate, RFLAGS.IF is cleared to 0.
    - If the gate descriptor is a trap gate, RFLAGS.IF is not modified.
9. Pushes the return CS register and RIP register onto the stack. The CS value is padded with six bytes to form a quadword.
10. If the interrupt vector number has an error code associated with it, pushes the error code onto the stack. The error code is padded with four bytes to form a quadword.
11. Loads the segment-selector field from the gate descriptor into the CS register. The processor checks that the target code-segment is a 64-bit mode code segment.
12. Loads the offset field from the gate descriptor into the target RIP. The interrupt handler begins execution when control is transferred to the instruction referenced by the new RIP


The IST mechanism provides a method for
specific interrupts, such as NMI, double-fault, and machine-check, to always execute on a known good stack.

When enabled, the IST mechanism unconditionally switches stacks. It can be enabled on an individual
interrupt vector basis using a new field in the IDT gate-descriptor entry
> @todo IST机制中间一共只有7个，感觉过于奇怪啊



# 12 Task Management
Long mode, however, requires system software to initialize and maintain
certain task-management resources. The details of these resource-initialization requirements for long
mode are discussed in “Task-Management Resources” on page 330.

## 12.1 Hardware Multitasking Overview
Each task has its own execution space, consisting of:
- Code segment and instruction pointer.
- Data segments.
- Stack segments for each privilege level.
- General-purpose registers.
- rFLAGS register.
- Local-descriptor table.
- Task register, and a link to the previously-executed task.
- I/O-permission and interrupt-permission bitmaps.
- Pointer to the page-translation tables (CR3).
> @todo 可以每一个项目加以分析 long mode 中间也有这一个内容吗 ?

## 12.2 Task-Management Resources
While system software is
not required to use the hardware-multitasking features,
it is required to initialize certain task management resources for at least one task (the current task) when running in protected mode. This
single task is needed to establish the protected-mode execution environment. The resources that must
be initialized are:
- Task-State Segment (TSS)—A segment that holds the processor state associated with a task.
- TSS Descriptor—A segment descriptor that defines the task-state segment.
- TSS Selector—A segment selector that references the TSS descriptor located in the GDT.
- Task Register—A register that holds the TSS selector and TSS descriptor for the current task.


Although the hardware task-switching mechanism is not supported in long mode, **a 64-bit task state
segment (TSS) must still exist**.
System software must create **at least one 64-bit TSS** for use after
activating long mode, and **it must execute the LTR instruction**, in 64-bit mode, to load the TR register
with a pointer to the 64-bit TSS that serves both 64-bit-mode programs and compatibility-mode
programs.

The legacy TSS contains several fields used for saving and restoring processor-state information. The
legacy fields include general-purpose register, EFLAGS, CR3 and segment-selector register state,
among others. **Those legacy fields are not supported** by the 64-bit TSS. System software must save and
restore the necessary processor-state information required by the software-multitasking
implementation (if multitasking is supported). Figure 12-8 on page 341 shows the format of a 64-bit
TSS.
The 64-bit TSS holds several pieces of information important to long mode that are not directly related
to the task-switch mechanism:
1. `RSPn`—Bytes 1Bh–04h. The full 64-bit canonical forms of the stack pointers (RSP) for privilege
levels 0 through 2.
2.  `ISTn`—Bytes 5Bh–24h. The full 64-bit canonical forms of the *interrupt-stack-table (IST)* pointers.
See “Interrupt-Stack Table” on page 253 for a description of the IST mechanism.
3. `I/O Map Base Address`—Bytes 67h–66h. The 16-bit offset to the I/O-permission bit map from the
64-bit TSS base. The function of this field is identical to that in a legacy 32-bit TSS. See “I/O Permission Bitmap” on page 338 for more information.
> TSS 中间的内容似乎根本没有任何关系啊

# 14 Processor Initialization and Long Mode Activation

## 14.1 Processor Initialization
The `RESET` method places the processor in a known state and prepares it to begin execution in real
mode. The `INIT` method is similar except it does not modify the state of certain registers.

**Fetching the First Instruction**

After a RESET or INIT, the processor is operating in 16-bit real mode. Normally within real mode, the
code-segment base-address is formed by shifting the **CS-selector** value left four bits. The base address
is then added to the value in EIP to form the physical address into memory. As a result, the processor
can only address the first 1 Mbyte of memory when in real mode.

However, immediately following RESET or INIT, the CS-selector register is **loaded with F000h**, but
the CS base-address is not formed by left-shifting the selector. Instead, the CS base-address is
initialized to FFFF_0000h. EIP is initialized to FFF0h. Therefore, the first instruction fetched from
memory is located at physical-address **FFFF_FFF0h** (FFFF_0000h + 0000_FFF0h).
> @question 说好的只能访问20bit 为什么忽然就可以访问4G空间啊!
> 第一条指令地址在FFFF_FFF0h，那么如果物理内存没有4G 那不是很尴尬!


The CS base-address remains at this initial value until the CS-selector register is loaded by software.
This can occur as a result of executing a far jump instruction or call instruction, for example. When CS
is loaded by software, the new base-address value is established as defined for real mode (by left
shifting the selector value four bits)

Software can enable these caches by
clearing the cache-disable bit (CR0.CD) to zero (RESET sets this bit to 1). Software can further **refine**
caching based on individual pages and memory regions
> @todo refine 在此处具体是指什么东西啊？

**Initializing Media and x87 Processor State**

**Model-Specific Initialization**

## 14.3 Initializing Real Mode
A basic real-mode (real-address-mode) operating environment must be initialized so that system
software can initialize the protected-mode operating environment. This real-mode environment must
include:
1. A real-mode IDT for vectoring interrupts and exceptions to the appropriate handlers while in real
mode. The IDT base-address value in the IDTR initialized by the processor can be used, or system
software can relocate the IDT by loading a new base-address into the IDTR.
2. The real-mode interrupt and exception handlers. These must be loaded before enabling external
interrupts.
Because the processor can always accept a non-maskable interrupt (NMI), it is possible an NMI
can occur before initializing the IDT or the NMI handler. System hardware must provide a
mechanism for disabling NMIs to allow time for the IDT and NMI handler to be properly
initialized. Alternatively, the IDT and NMI handler can be stored in non-volatile memory that is
referenced by the initial values loaded into the IDTR.
Maskable interrupts can be enabled by setting EFLAGS.IF after the real-mode IDT and interrupt
handlers are initialized.
3. A valid stack pointer (SS:SP) to be used by the interrupt mechanism should interrupts or
exceptions occur. The values of SS:SP initialized by the processor can be used.
4. One or more data-segment selectors for storing the protected-mode data structures that are created
in real mode.

## 14.4 Initializing Protected Mode
idt and gdt for 32bit


## 14.5 Initializing Long Mode
1. idt and gdt for 64bit

A GDT containing segment descriptors for software running in 64-bit mode and compatibility
mode, including:
- Any LDT descriptors required by the operating system or application software.
- A TSS descriptor for the single 64-bit TSS required by long mode.
- Code descriptors for the code segments that are executed in long mode. The code-segment
descriptors are used to specify whether the processor is operating in 64-bit mode or
compatibility mode. See “Code-Segment Descriptors” on page 88, “Long (L) Attribute Bit” on
page 89, and “CS Register” on page 71 for more information.
- Data-segment descriptors for software running in compatibility mode. The DS, ES, and SS
segments are ignored in 64-bit mode. See “Data-Segment Descriptors” on page 89 for more
information.
- FS and GS data-segment descriptors for 64-bit mode, if required by the operating system. If
these segments are used in 64-bit mode, system software can also initialize the full 64-bit base
addresses using the WRMSR instruction.
*The existing protected-mode GDT can be used to hold the long-mode descriptors described above.*


2. A single 64-bit TSS for holding the privilege-level 0, 1, and 2 stack pointers, the interrupt-stacktable pointers, and the I/O-redirection-bitmap base address (if required). This is the only TSS
required, because hardware task-switching is not supported in long mode. See “64-Bit Task State
Segment” on page 339 for more information.
> 什么叫做io-redirection bitmap
3. The 4-level page-translation tables required by long mode. Long mode also requires the use of
physical-address extensions (PAE) to support physical-address sizes greater than 32 bits. See
“Long-Mode Page Translation” on page 130 for more information

Long mode is enabled by setting the long-mode enable control bit (EFER.LME) to 1. However, long
mode is not activated until software also enables paging. When software enables paging while long
mode is enabled, the processor activates long mode, which the processor indicates by setting the longmode-active status bit (EFER.LMA) to 1. The processor behaves as a 32-bit x86 processor in all
respects until long mode is activated, even if long mode is enabled. None of the new 64-bit data sizes,
addressing, or system aspects available in long mode can be used until EFER.LMA=1
> 首先需要LME 然后 LMA 才可以，@question 但是为什么要这样设计啊

Switching the processor to long mode requires several steps. In general, the sequence involves
disabling paging (CR0.PG=0), enabling physical-address extensions (CR4.PAE=1), loading CR3,
enabling long mode (EFER.LME=1), and finally enabling paging (CR0.PG=1).

# 16 Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC)
The local APIC accepts interrupts from the system and delivers them to the
local CPU core interrupt handler.

Support for APIC is indicated by CPUID Fn0000_0001_EDX[APIC] = 1.
> @todo 编程测试一下 CPUID

Each CPU core has an associated local APIC which receives interrupts from the following sources:
- I/O interrupts from the IOAPIC interrupt controller (including LINT0 and LINT1)
- Legacy interrupts (INTR and NMI) from the legacy interrupt controller
- Message Signalled Interrupts
- Interprocessor Interrupts (IPIs) from other local APICs. Interprocessor Interrupts are used to send
interrupts or to execute system wide functions between CPU cores in the system, including the
originating CPU core (self-interrupt).
- Locally generated interrupts within the local APIC. The local APIC receives local interrupts from
the APIC timer, Performance Monitor Counters, thermal sensors, APIC errors and extended
interrupts from implementation specific sources

## 16.2 Interrupt Control
> 总体来说，没有我想要的东西啊!
> 我们的疑惑是什么:
> 1. 到底idt 中间一共含有多少项目是处理external interrupt 的的
> 2. external interrupt 的消息中间的内容是什么，类似于键盘的内容，interrupt 中间含有包含的键吗 ? 如果是网卡，其包含一个网络包的数据(显然不可能的)

I/O, legacy, and interprocessor interrupts are sent **via** interrupt messages. The **interrupt messages**
contain the following information:
> 那就是实际上，并不是只一个bit 的信息，而是一组信息

A separate entry in the **local vector table** is provided for each interrupt to allow software to specify:
- Whether the interrupt is masked or not.
- The delivery status of the interrupt.
- The message type.
- The unique address vector.
- For LINT0 and LINT1 interrupts, the trigger mode, remote IRR, and input pin polarity
- For the APIC timer interrupt, the timer mode.

## 16.5 Interprocessor Interrupts (IPI)
A local APIC can send interrupts to other local APICs (or itself) using software-initiated
Interprocessor Interrupts (IPIs) using the Interrupt Command Register (ICR). Writing into the low
order doubleword of the ICR causes the IPI to be sent.

## 16.6 Local APIC Handling of Interrupts

Without an IO-APIC, interrupts from hardware will be delivered only to the CPU which boots the operating system (usually CPU#0).
