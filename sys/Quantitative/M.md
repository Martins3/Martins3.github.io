## M.2 The early developement of Computers

**digital computers**

**performance measurement**

[mercury delay line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_line_memory)

[Harvard Architecture]()

instruction time -> mix instruction time -> MIPS -> relative MIPS -> MFLOPS -> SPEC


## M.3 The development of Memory Hierarchy and Protection
Virtual memory

cache:
  1. direct-mapped cache
  2. spatial locality and temporal locality
  1. nonblocking cache
  2. prefetching


## M.4 The Evolution of Instruction Sets
stack architecture

VAX

RISC

## M.5 The Development of Pipelining and Instruction-Level Parallelism
