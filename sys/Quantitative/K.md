# Survey of Instruction Set Architectures

## Introduction
#### K1
describe what this chapter mainly talk about and in which way.
## A Survey of RISC Architectures for Desktop, Server, and Embedded Computers
#### K2
The first group is the desktop, server RISCs, and PMD processors:

The second group is the embedded RISCs designed for lower-end applications:

In all three, the 16-bit instructions are versions of 32-bit instructions, typically with a restricted set of registers.The idea is to
reduce the code size by replacing common 32-bit instructions with 16-bit versions.
