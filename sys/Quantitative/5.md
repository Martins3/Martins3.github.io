### Models of Memory Consistency: An Introduction

##### Relaxed Consistency Model: The Basic and Release Consistency


| Relaxing Order  | Model Name                                                                           |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| W-\>R           | total store ordering, processor consistency                                          |
| W-\>R  && W-\>W | partial store order                                                                  |
| Relax All       | weak order, PowerPc consistency model. release consistency, RISC V consistency model |
