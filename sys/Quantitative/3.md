# Instruction-Level Parallelism and it's Exploitation

## Reducing Branch Costs With Advanced Branch Prediction

#### 182
Loop unrolling is one way to reduce the number of branch hazards; we can also reduce the performance losses of branches by predicting how they will behave

As the number of instructions in flight has increased with deeper pipelines and more issues per clock, the importance of more accurate branch prediction has grown
#### 183
It may be possible to improve the prediction accuracy if we also look at the recent behavior of other branches rather than just the branch we are trying to predict

Branch predictors that use the behavior of other branches to make a prediction are called correlating predictors or two-level predictors.

In the general case, an (m,n) predictor uses the behavior of the last m branches to choose from 2^m branch predictors, each of which is an n-bit predictor for a single branch

The simplicity of the hardware comes from a simple observation: the global
history of the most recent m branches can be recorded in an m-bit shift register,
where each bit records whether the branch was taken or not taken. The branchprediction buffer can then be indexed using a concatenation of the low-order bits
from the branch address with the m-bit global history

The attraction of this type of correlating branch predictor
is that it can yield higher prediction rates than the 2-bit scheme and requires only a
trivial amount of additional hardware.
> trivial, P184's example will show why

> 见山是熔岩巨兽，见海是潮汐海灵， 见花是荆棘之兴。 唯独见了你， 是厄加特。

#### P184
How much better do the correlating branch predictors work when compared with the standard 2-bit scheme?

In gshare the index is formed by combining the address of the branch and the most recent conditional branch outcomes using an exclusiveOR, which essentially acts as a hash of the branch address and the branch history.

The hashed result is used to index a prediction array of 2-bit counters, as shown in
Figure 3.4. The gshare predictor works remarkably well for a simple predictor, and
is often used as the baseline for comparison with more sophisticated predictors.

Predictors that combine local branch information and global branch history are also
called alloyed predictors or hybrid predictors.
> if same history and address, we can refer to same to location, if different history, even same address,  different place
> of course, interference is possible, but if data is 

#### P185
Adding global history could help remedy this situation.
Tournament predictors take this insight to the next level, by using multiple predictors, usually a global predictor and a local predictor, and choosing between them with a selector.

A global predictor uses the most recent branch history to index the predictor, while a local predictor uses the address
of the branch as the index

existing tournament predictors use a 2-bit saturating counter per branch to choose among two
different predictors based on which predictor (local, global, or even some timevarying mix) was most effective in recent predictions


#### P186
The number of bits of the branch address used to index the selector table and the local predictor table is equal to the length of the global branch history used to index the global prediction table.

Note that misprediction is a bit tricky because we need to change both the selector table and either the global or local predictor.

The local predictor consists of a two-level predictor. The top level is a local
history table consisting of 1024 10-bit entries; each 10-bit entry corresponds to
the most recent 10 branch outcomes for the entry. The selected entry from the local history table is used to index a table
of 1K entries consisting of 3-bit saturating counters, which provide the local prediction. This combination, which uses a total of *29K* bits, 

>  why 29K bits, and use history to index 3-bit saturating counters is ridiculous

#### P188
The best performing branch prediction schemes as of 2017 involve combining
multiple predictors that track whether a prediction is likely to be associated with
the current branch

This class of branch predictors, which
we call tagged hybrid predictors (see Seznec and Michaud, 2006), employs a
series of global predictors indexed with different length histories.


#### P189
a five-component tagged hybrid predictor
has five prediction tables: P(0), P(1), . . . P(4), where P(i) is accessed using a hash of
the PC and the history of the most recent i branches (kept in a shift register, h, just
as in gshare)


A prediction from P(1), . . . P(4) is used only if the tags match the hash of the branch address and global branch history.

The difference between gshare and tagged hybrid predictor:
1. The use of multiple history lengths to index separate predictors is the first critical difference.
2. The second critical difference is the use of tags in tables P(1) through P(4). 

Each of the predictors in P(0…n) can be a standard 2-bit predictor. In practice a 3-bit counter, which requires three mispredictions to change a prediction, gives slightly better results than a 2-bit counter

The prediction for a given branch is the predictor with the longest branch history that also has matching tags.
> so what is the fucking **tags**, tags is the part of history, whoes lenght vary from 4bit to 10 bits.

P(0) always matches because it uses no tags and becomes the default prediction if none of P(1) through P(n) match

1. The tagged hybrid version of this predictor also includes a 2-bit *use field* in each of the history-indexed predictors
2. The use field indicates whether a prediction was recently used and therefore likely to be more accurate;
3. the use field can be periodically reset in all entries so that old predictions are cleared

Many more details are involved in implementing this style of predictor, especially how to handle mispredictions. The search space for the optimal predictor is also very large because the
number of predictors, the exact history used for indexing, and the size of each predictor are all variable
> tune parameters ? deep learning ?

1. Another issue for larger predictors is how to initialize the predictor. 
2. Some predictors (including many recent predictors) include a valid bit, indicating whether an entry in the predictor has been set or is in the “unused state.” 
3. We could also set the initial prediction on the basis of the branch direction: forward going branches are initialized as not taken, while backward going
branches, which are likely to be loop branches, are initialized as taken

#### P192
three advantages

> the first two advantage is the same, why should sperate them into two pieces

#### P193

why we need dynamic scheduling

out-of-order-execution introduce WAR and WAW hazard and both of them can be avoid by reg renaming


#### P194



#### P194

major complication is handling exceptions

inprecise exception can be caused by two possibilities

_P195_

Scoreboarding is a technique for allowing instruction to execute out of order when there are sufficient resources and no data dependences

Tomasulo's algorithm is more complex but more effcient

Two main principal of Tomasulo's algorithm: dynamically determining when an instruction is ready to execute and renaming registers to avoid unnecessary hazards

how will we explain the algorithm

_P196_

Register renaming rename all the destination register, including those with a pending read or write for an earlier instruction.



| Hazard | Explanation                                                             | Caused by    |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|

| RAW    | read too quickly, former instruction haven't get the correct result yet | in-order     |


Tomasulo's algorithm can handle renaming across branches.

Tomasulo's algorithm use **resrevation stations** for renaming which buffer the operands instruction waiting to issue and are associated with the functional units.

It is important to remember that the tags in Tomasulo scheme refer to the buffer or unit that will produce a result.

> what is *reservation station*, no definition again ?

Each reservation has seven fields

The register file has a field

The load and store each have a field


## Dynamic Scheduling: Example and the Algorithm

> Dynamic Scheduling, out-of-ordre and speculation, they are the same thing or different ?

_**P201**_

show a example

Tomusulo's scheme offers two major advamtages:
1. the distribution of the hazard detection logic
2. the elimination of stalls for WAW and WAR hazards

the first advantage arises from the distributed reservation stations and the use of CDB


## 3.6 Hardware-Based Speculation

#### P208
Branch prediction reduces the direct stalls
attributable to branches, but for a processor executing multiple instructions per
clock, just predicting branches accurately may not be sufficient to generate the
desired amount of instruction-level parallelism

A wide-issue processor may need
to **execute a branch** every clock cycle to maintain maximum performance

Hardware-based speculation combines three key ideas:
1. dynamic branch prediction to choose which instructions to execute,
2. speculation to allow the execution of instructions before the control dependences are resolved
(with the ability to undo the effects of an incorrectly speculated sequence),
3. dynamic scheduling to deal with the scheduling of different combinations of basic blocks. (In comparison, dynamic scheduling without speculation
only partially overlaps basic blocks because it requires that a branch be
resolved before actually executing any instructions in the successor basic
block.)

> *dynamic scheduling to deal with the scheduling of different combinations of basic blocks.* so what is *basic blocks*

#### P209
> *To extend Tomasulo’s algorithm to support speculation, we must separate the
bypassing of results among instructions, which is needed to execute an instruction
speculatively, from the actual completion of an instruction*

> separate, how, and separate what 

When an instruction is no longer speculative, we allow it to update the register file or memory;
we call this additional step in the instruction execution sequence **instruction commit**.

The key idea behind implementing speculation is to allow instructions to execute out of order but to force them to commit in order and to prevent any irrevocable action (such as updating state or taking an exception) until an **instruction
commits**
> can you prove this

Adding this commit phase
to the instruction execution sequence requires an additional set of hardware buffers
that hold the results of instructions that have finished execution but have not committed. This hardware buffer, which we call the **reorder buffer**, is also used to pass
results among instructions that may be speculated

The ROB holds the result of an instruction between the time the operation associated with
the instruction completes and the time the instruction commits

With speculation, the register file is not updated
until the instruction commits (and we know definitively that the instruction should
execute)

The ROB is similar to the store buffer in Tomasulo’s algorithm, and we integrate the function of the store buffer into the ROB for simplicity
> similarity, maybe can register file and memory are similar

Each entry in the ROB contains four fields:
1. the instruction type *The instruction type field indicates whether the instruction is a branch (and has no destination result), a store (which has a memory address destination), or a register operation (ALU operation or load, which has register destinations).*
2. the destination field *The destination field supplies the register number (for loads and ALU operations) or the memory address (for stores) where the instruction result should be written.*
3. the value field *The value field is used to hold the value of the instruction result until the instruction commits. We will see an example of ROB entries shortly.*
4. the ready field *Finally, the ready field indicates that the instruction has completed execution, and the value is ready.*

#### P210
Stores still execute in two steps, but the second step is performed by instruction commit.

Although the renaming function
of the reservation stations is replaced by the ROB, we still need a place to buffer operations (and operands) between the time they issue and the time they begin execution

Because every instruction
has a positioninthe ROB until it commits,we tag a result using the ROB entry number
rather than using the reservation station number.This tagging requires that the ROB
assigned for an instruction must be tracked in the reservation station.

> Later in this section, wewill explore an alternative implementation that uses extra registers for renaming and a queue that replaces the ROB to decide when instructions can commit
> great, some familiar

#### P211
Here are the four steps involved in instruction execution

| Stage        | trigger requirement                                                                                                                                                                                  | action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

the store is updated. For simplicity we assume that this occurs during the Write
Result stage of a store; we discuss relaxing this requirement later.*
what is meaning of *update*, as i think, store value is as simple as write to register, available then write or just wait.

## 3.7 Exploiting ILP Using Multiple Issue and Static Scheduling


#### P218
Multiple-issue processors come in three major flavors:
1. Statically scheduled superscalar processors
2. VLIW (very long instruction word) processors
3. Dynamically scheduled superscalar processors

The two types of superscalar processors issue varying numbers of instructions per
clock and use in-order execution if they are statically scheduled or out-of-order
execution if they are dynamically scheduled.

Although statically scheduled superscalars issue a varying rather than a
fixed number of instructions per clock, they are actually closer in concept to
VLIWs because both approaches rely on the compiler to schedule code for
the processor

Because of the diminishing advantages of a statically scheduled
superscalar as the issue width grows, statically scheduled superscalars are used
primarily for narrow issue widths, normally just two instructions

#### P219
as we will see later in this chapter, the growth in overhead is a major factor limiting wider issue processors


## 3.8 Exploiting ILP Using Dynamic Scheduling, Multiple Issue, and Speculation

#### P222
Two different approaches have been used to issue multiple instructions per
clock in a dynamically scheduled processor, and both rely on the observation that
the key is assigning a reservation station and updating the pipeline control tables.
1. One approach is to run this step in half a clock cycle so that two instructions can be processed in one clock cycle;
2. A second alternative is to build the logic necessary to handle two or more instructions at once, including any possible dependences between the instructions.

#### P223
> *A key observation is that we cannot simply pipeline away the problem* pipeline away the porblem  is what ?

Modern superscalar processors that issue four or more instructions per clock may
include both approaches: They both pipeline and widen the issue logic

By making instruction issues take multiple clocks because new instructions are issuing every
clock cycle, we must be able to assign the reservation station and to *update the
pipeline tables* so that a dependent instruction issuing on the next clock can use
the updated information
> where is the pipeline table, no definition at all

#### P224
In a modern superscalar, every possible combination of dependent instructions that is allowed to issue in the same clock cycle must be considered.
Because the number of possibilities climbs as the square of the number of instructions that can be issued in a clock, the issue step is a likely bottleneck for attempts to go beyond four instructions per clock.

1. Assign a reservation station and a reorder buffer for every instruction that might be issued in the next issue bundle
2. Analyze all the dependences among the instructions in the issue bundle
3. If an instruction in the bundle depends on an earlier instruction in the bundle, use the assigned reorder buffer number to update the reservation table for the dependent instruction

Of course, what makes the preceding very complicated is that it is all done in parallel in a single clock cycle!

> if we keep dependences, we can issue multiple instructions at the same time
#### P225
To illustrate the complexity of this process, Figure 3.22 shows the issue logic for one case: issuing a load followed by a dependent FP operation.

For the issuing instructions,
rd1 and rd2 are the destinations;
rs1, rs2, and rt2 are the sources (the load has only one source);
x1 and x2 are the reservation stations allocated;
and b1 and b2 are the assigned ROB entries.
RS is the reservation station data structure.
RegisterStat is the register data structure,
Regs represents the actual registers,
and ROB is the reorder buffer data structure. 

Notice that we need to have assigned reorder buffer entries for this logic to operate properly, and recall that all these updates happen in a single clock cycle in parallel, not sequentiall
```
if (RegisterStat[rs1].Busy){ /*in-flight instr. writes rs*/
  h = RegisterStat[rs1].Reorder;
  if (ROB[h].Ready){ /* Instr completed already */
    RS[x1].Vj = ROB[h].Value;
    RS[x1].Qj = 0;
  } else {
    RS[x1].Qj = h;
  }
} else { /* wait for instruction */
  RS[x1].Vj = Regs[rs];
  RS[x1].Qj = 0;
};

RS[x1].Busy = yes;
RS[x1].Dest = b1;

ROB[b1].Instruction = Load;
ROB[b1].Dest = rd1;
ROB[b1].Ready = no;

RS[r].A = imm1;

RegisterStat[rt1].Reorder = b1;
RegisterStat[rt1].Busy = yes;

ROB[b1].Dest = rt1; // this line should be a mistake
```

> if benefit is of sequensial issue is keeping the dependence if there is !

## 3.9 Advanced Techniques for Instruction Delivery and Speculation

#### P228
In a high-performance pipeline, especially one with multiple issues,
predicting branches well is not enough; we actually have to be able to deliver a
high-bandwidth instruction stream

**Branch-Targe Buffers**
Of course, fetching these instructions requires wide enough paths to the
instruction cache, but the most difficult aspect is handling branches
> I can not feel the difficult at all, just fetch as many instruction as cache supply, so what ?

A branch-prediction cache that stores the predicted address for the next
instruction after a branch is called a branch-target buffer or branch-target cache

If a matching entry is found in the branch-target buffer, fetching begins immediately at the predicted PC

*Note that unlike a branch-prediction buffer, the predictive entry must be matched to this instruction because the predicted PC will be sent out before it is known whether this instruction is even a branch. If the processor did
not check whether the entry matched this PC, then the wrong PC would be sent out
for instructions that were not branches, resulting in worse performance.*
> unlike branch-prediction buffer, so how branch-prediction works ?
> check whether the entry matched this PC, check what ?

#### P229
Dealing with the mispredictions and misses is a significant challenge because we typically will have to halt
instruction fetch while we rewrite the buffer entry

#### P231
One variation on the branch-target buffer is to store one or more target instructions instead of, or in addition to, the predicted target address.
1. First, it allows the branch-target buffer access to take
longer than the time between successive instruction fetches, possibly allowing a
larger branch-target buffer
2. Second, buffering the actual target instructions allows
us to perform an optimization called branch folding. **Branch folding** can be used to
obtain 0-cycle unconditional branches and sometimes 0-cycle conditional
branches
> the first reason seems stupid, not *it allow*, it's *it made have to*

#### P232
As we try to increase the opportunity and accuracy of speculation, we face the challenge of predicting indirect jumps, that is, jumps whose destination address varies
at runtime.

To overcome this problem,
some designs use a small buffer of return addresses operating as a stack

In large server applications, indirect jumps also occur for various function calls
and control transfers
> *control transfer* is what ? any differences ?

Although a simple predictor like gshare does a good job of predicting many conditional branches, it is not tailored to predicting loop branches, especially
for long running loops

With the emergence of tagged hybrid predictors, which are as good at predicting loop branches, some recent designers have opted to put the resources into larger tagged hybrid predictors rather than a separate loop
branch predictor.

**Integrated Instruction Fetch Units**

Essentially, this amounts to
recognizing that characterizing instruction fetch as a simple single pipe stage given
the complexities of multiple issue is no longer valid.
> 本质上来说，这相当于认识到将指令读取作为一个简单的流水线阶段让多发射不在复杂。

Instead, recent designs have used an integrated instruction fetch unit that integrates several functions:
1. Integrated branch prediction 
2. Instruction prefetch
3. Instruction memory access and buffering

**Speculation Support: Register Renaming Versus Reorder Buffers**
> who can tell me, what is register rename ?

key: think of architectural registers as **names**, not **locations**
0. can have more locations than names
1. dynamically map names to locations
2. map table holds the current mappings (name→location)
  1. write: allocate new location and record it in map table
  2. read: find location of most recent write by name lookup in map table
  3. minor detail: must de-allocate locations appropriately
#### P236
Without speculation, there is little motivation to try to increase the issue rate
beyond two, three, or possibly four issues per clock because resolving branches
would limit the average issue rate to a smaller number.

All the dependences must be detected the physical registers must be assigned, and the instructions must be rewritten
using the physical register numbers: in one clock. 

The difficulty is that all this renaming and replacement of architectural registers by
physical renaming registers happens effectively in 1 cycle, not sequentially. The issue logic must find all the dependences and “rewrite” the instruction in parallel
> where and when *pysical register*, *map*, *architectural register* are introduce in register renaming ?
> but it din't explained clearly at all


The Commit step is the dual of the issue
step, and the requirements are similar, so let’s take a look at what has to happen for
a six-issue processor using register renaming.
> *dual*, how, can't follow author's idea at all

#### P237
**How much to speculate**
To maintain most of the advantage while minimizing the disadvantages, most
pipelines with speculation will allow only low-cost exceptional events (such as a
first-level cache miss) to be handled in speculative mode. 

#### P238
**Speculating Through Multiple Branches**
In the examples we have considered in this chapter, it has been possible to *resolve a
branch before having to speculate on another*. Three different situations can benefit
from speculating on multiple branches simultaneously: 
1. a very high branch frequency,
2. significant clustering of branches, and
3. long delays in functional units

**Speculation and the Challenge of Energy Efficiency**
At first glance, one might
argue that using speculation always decreases energy efficiency because whenever
speculation is wrong, it consumes excess energy in two ways:
1. Instructions that are speculated and whose results are not needed generate excess work for the processor, wasting energy.
2. Undoing the speculation and restoring the state of the processor to continue execution at the appropriate address consumes additional energy that would not be
needed without speculation

> Figure 3.30 if 164.gzip and other integer program can cause up to 40% extra misspeculation instruction, how can the rate of misspeculation is only 3% as Figure 3.6 suggests.

#### P239
**Address Aliasing Prediction**
Address aliasing prediction is a technique that predicts whether two stores or a load and a store refer to the same memory address

Address prediction
relies on the ability of a speculative processor to recover after a misprediction;
