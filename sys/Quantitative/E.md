# Embedded Systems

## E.1 Introduction

#### E2
compariration between embedded and desktop or servers
#### E3
another important trend in embedded system
#### E4
introduce *real-time performance requirement* and show some architectual properies to handle it.
## Signal Processing and Embedded Applications:The Digital Signal Processor
#### E5
DSP typical features special-purpose hadware to perform it's task
#### E6
DSP use fixed point, wider register to guard agaist round-off error, operation for *forward error correction*
#### E7
T1 320C55 have seven stage
#### E8
descripe C55's instruction cache, power management, MAC units

T1 320C6x is similar to VLIW processor and explain why it prefer VLIW instread of superscale
#### E9

## Embedded Benchmark
#### E12
EEMBC
#### E13
efficient use of power to achieve high perfermance can be not suitable for battery-based devices.
## Embedded Multiprocessors
#### E14
a number of special-purpose designs have used customized multiporssor

MXP processor
#### E15
Multiprocessing is becoming widespread in the embedded computing arena for
two primary reasons.
