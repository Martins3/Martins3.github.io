# Coherence Protocols

## 6.1 THE BIg PICTuRE
To implement these invariants, we associate with each storage structure—each cache and the
LLC/memory—a finite state machine called a coherence controller.

*A memory controller is similar to a cache controller, except that it usually
has only a network side. As such, it does not issue coherence requests (on behalf of loads or stores)
or receive coherence responses*
> 这和图上表现不符啊，显然LLC/memory 是可以 issue coherence requests　和　receive coherence responses

## 6.4 OVERVIEW OF COHERENCE PROTOCOL DESIgN SPACE
However, unlike
the choices of **stable states** and **transactions**, **the events**, **transitions** and **specific transient states** are
highly dependent on the coherence protocol and cannot be discussed in isolation

### 6.4.1 States
 There are four characteristics of
a cache block that we wish to encode in its state: validity, dirtiness, exclusivity, and ownership.
The latter two characteristics are unique to systems with multiple actors
> 鬼鬼，道理我都懂，但是这些词汇的含义难道不是一个意思吗?
#### 6.4.1.1 Stable States
#### 6.4.1.2 Transient States

#### 6.4.1.3 States of Blocks in the LLC/Memory
*For example, if a block is in all caches in I, then the LLC/memory state for this block is I.
If a block is in one or more caches in S, then the LLC/memory state is S. If a block is in a
single cache in M, then the LLC/memory state is M*
> 所有的cache中间该block都是invalid,那么LLC/memory为什么就一定是I, 有没有可能是LLC/memory中间保存了一份


#### 6.4.1.4 Maintaining Block State
Coherence protocols may have many more transient
states, but need maintain these states only for those blocks that have pending coherence transactions. Implementations typically maintain these transient states by adding additional bits to the
miss status handling registers (MSHRs) or similar structures that are used to track these pending
transactions

With an inclusive LLC, memory does not need to explicitly represent the coherence
state. If a block resides in the LLC, its state in memory is the same as its state in the LLC.

### 6.4.2 Transactions
In Table 6.4 we list a set of common transactions and, for each transaction, we
describe the goal of the requestor that initiates the transaction

*These transactions are all initiated by cache controllers that are responding to requests from their associated cores.*

| Transaction         | Goal of Requestor                                                                                                                              |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GetShared (GetS)    | obtain block in Shared (read-only) state                                                                                                       |
| GetModified (GetM)  | obtain block in Modified (read-write) state                                                                                                    |
| Upgrade (Upg)       | upgrade block state from read-only (Shared or Owned) to read-write (Modified); Upg (unlike GetM) does not require data to be sent to requestor |
| PutShared (PutS)    | evict block in Shared state(a)                                                                                                                 |
| PutExclusive (PutE) | evict block in Exclusive state(a)                                                                                                              |
| PutOwned (PutO)     | evict block in Owned state                                                                                                                     |
| PutModified (PutM)  | evict block in Modified state                                                                                                                  |

a: Some protocols do not require a coherence transaction to evict a Shared block and/or an Exclusive block (i.e., the
PutS and/or PutE are “silent”).
