# 5 Relaxed Memory Consistency
 Both models(SC, TSO) are sometimes called strong because the global memory order of each
model usually respects (preserves) per-thread program order

The principal drawbacks are that relaxed
models must formalize when ordering is “required” and provide mechanisms for programmers or
low-level software to communicate such ordering to implementations, and vendors have failed to
agree on a single relaxed model, compromising portability

## 5.1 MOTIVATION
### 5.1.1 Opportunities to Reorder Memory Operations
If proper operation does not depend on ordering among many loads and stores, perhaps one
could obtain higher performance by relaxing the order among them, since loads and stores are typically much more frequent than lock acquires and releases. This is what relaxed or weak models do.
### 5.1.2 Opportunities to Exploit Reordering
##### 5.1.2.1 Non-FIFO, Coalescing Write Buffer
Although a FIFO write buffer improves performance, an even more optimized design would use a non-FIFO write buffer that permits coalescing of writes.
##### 5.1.2.2 Simpler Support for Core Speculation
> 大致含义: 因为MIPS R10000需要保证SC,所以当推测load/store中出现了违背，就需要撤销，检查的方式使用cache的淘汰项
> 我可以理解这一个检查方式

##### 5.1.2.3 Coupling Consistency and Coherence
However, “opening the coherence box” incurs considerable intellectual and verification complexity, bringing
to mind the Greek myth about Pandora’s box.

## 5.2 AN EXAMPLE RELAXED CONSISTENCY MODEL (XC)

### 5.2.1 The Basic Idea of the XC Model
XC maintains TSO rules for ordering two accesses to the same address only:
1. Load → Load to same address
2. Load → Store to the same address
3. Store → Store to the same address

These rules enforce the sequential processor model (i.e., sequential core semantics) and prohibit behaviors that might astonish programmers.

### 5.2.2 Examples using FENCEs under XC
### 5.2.3 Formalizing XC
Program order \<p is a per-processor total order that captures the order in which each core logically (sequentially) executes memory operations.
Global memory order \<m is a total order on the memory
operations of all cores
