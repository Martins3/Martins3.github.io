## Rethink
Is soul mate is the only criteria for lover ? It depends on the meaning of soul while someone think the soul is characters and others regard it as hobbies.
Soul is by no means composed of games, soap opera, movies  and other commercial products.
Soul is composed of experience and characters, the former means what has been done in the past and the latter determines what will be do.

Sometimes, I regard sex as most torturing punishment that human is suffering. Without sex, I will be able to concentrate myself on, indulge in the games, crunch in the
cornet and take no responsibility. Pure sex is industrial goods, only when it's ingredient of intimate can it be gorgeous.
