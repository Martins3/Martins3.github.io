> The author did an experiment what would happen if he turn on all the notifications. We found something apparent and imperceptible:
>
> 1. One email means six different notifications. It can be an icon on browser tab, an actual pop-up on my desktop, a merry jingle, a buzz from my phone, banner notifications and a green notification light
> 2. The “Snowball Effect” of distraction. A single pick up can set off a chain of reaction. Notifications are strong lure, you can't just ignore it. After you have checked it, you couldn't help to wander about it !
> 3. You will gradually develop a habit of picking up the phone to check for non-existent notifications.
>
> Notifications don’t just disrupt you, they destroy your ability to focus long-term. Checking the notifications, or exaggerating some news to attract attention of audience is a sign of social helplessness.
> Just admit that earth will spin as before even without your presence.
