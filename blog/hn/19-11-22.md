Recently, I suddenly turn my entertainment subject from Bilibili and Lol to Dota. A wired feeling notify me from time to time,
I have become someone I should be unfamiliar with, someone I thought I would have no common language.
Hobbies and interest changes quickly, and isn't critical elements contributing to fall in love with someone.
In fact, I'm still myself because my new hobbies still project my characteristics.

Depression rushed into my mind before I found that I didn't chat with anyone today.
Emotions seems can be controlled subjectively, but, in fact not.
I can't make me happier by telling myself please smile, but I can take a shower.
