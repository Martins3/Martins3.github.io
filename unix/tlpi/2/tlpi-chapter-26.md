# Linux Programming Interface: Monitor Child Process

In many application designs, a parent process needs to know when one of its child
processes changes state—when the child terminates or *is stopped by a signal*. This
chapter describes two techniques used to monitor child processes: the `wait()` system
call (and its variants) and the use of the `SIGCHLD` signal.


## 26.1 Waiting on a Child Process


## 26.2 Orphans and Zombies

> orphan : parent die firstly

Using the `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` operation of the Linux-specific prctl() system call, it
is possible to arrange that a process receives a specified signal when it becomes
an orphan

Regarding zombies, UNIX systems imitate the movies—a zombie process can’t be
killed by a signal, not even the (silver bullet) SIGKILL. This ensures that the parent
can always eventually perform a `wait()`

The parent may perform such wait() calls
either synchronously, or asynchronously, in response to delivery of the SIGCHLD signal.

## 26.3 The SIGCHLD Signal
To get around **these** problems, we can employ a handler for the `SIGCHLD` signal.

The `SIGCHLD` signal is sent to a parent process whenever one of its children terminates. By default, this signal is ignored, but we can catch it by installing a signal handler.
Within the signal handler, we can use `wait()` (or similar) to reap the zombie child.
However, there is a subtlety to consider in this approach.

The **solution** is to loop inside the `SIGCHLD` handler, repeatedly calling `waitpid()`
with the `WNOHANG` flag until there are no more dead children to be reaped. Often, the
body of a `SIGCHLD` handler simply consists of the following code, which reaps any
dead children without checking their status:
```c
while (waitpid(-1, NULL, WNOHANG) > 0)
  continue;
```
The above loop continues until `waitpid()` returns either 0, indicating no more zombie
children, or –1, indicating an error (probably `ECHILD`, meaning that there are no more children).

#### 26.3.2 Delivery of SIGCHLD for Stopped Children
if the flag(`SA_NOCLDSTOP`) is present, SIGCHLD is not delivered for stopped children

SUSv3 also allows for a parent to be sent a SIGCHLD signal if one of its stopped children is resumed by being sent a SIGCONT signal. (This corresponds to the WCONTINUED
flag for waitpid().) This feature is implemented in Linux since kernel 2.6.9.

#### Ignoring Dead Child Processes
Explicitly setting the disposition of SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN causes any child process that subsequently terminates to be immediately removed from the system instead of being converted
into a zombie. In this case, since the status of the child process is simply discarded,
a subsequent call to wait() (or similar) can’t return any information for the terminated child


## 26.4 Summary
Using `wait()` and `waitpid()` (and other related functions), a parent process can
obtain the status of its terminated and stopped children. **This status indicates
whether a child process terminated normally (with an exit status indicating either
success or failure), terminated abnormally, was stopped by a signal, or was resumed
by a `SIGCONT` signal.**

A common way of reaping dead child processes is to establish a handler for the
`SIGCHLD` signal. This signal is delivered to a parent process whenever one of its children terminates,
and optionally when a child is stopped by a signal. Alternatively,
but somewhat less portably, *a process may elect to set the disposition of SIGCHLD to
`SIG_IGN`, in which case the status of terminated children is immediately discarded (and
thus can’t later be retrieved by the parent), and the children don’t become zombies.*
