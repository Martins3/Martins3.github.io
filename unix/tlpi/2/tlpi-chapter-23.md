## 23.2 Scheduling and Accuracy of Timers
> For example, if a real-time timer is set to expire
every 2 seconds, then the delivery of individual timer events may be subject to the
delays just described, but the scheduling of subsequent expirations will nevertheless be at exactly the next 2-second interval. In other words, interval timers are not
subject to creeping errors.

> If this support is enabled (via the `CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS` kernel configuration option), then the accuracy of the various timer and sleep interfaces that we describe in this chapter is no longer constrained by the size of the kernel jiffy.
