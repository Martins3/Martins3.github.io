# Distributed System : Introduction

## 1.2 Design goals
> 书上也讲了这些东西

* **Being open**

Another important goal of distributed systems is openness. An open distributed system is essentially a system that offers components that can easily
be used by, or integrated into other systems. At the same time, an open
distributed system itself will often consist of components that originate from
elsewhere.


## 1.3 Types of distributed systems
> 来源于ppt 现在认真的读一下其中的内容

* **High performance distributed computing**
- Cluster computing systems
- Grid computing systems
- Clouds: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

* **Distributed Information Systems**
- Transaction processing systems
- Enterprise application integration

* **Pervasive Systems**
- Ubiquitous computing systems
- Mobile computing systems
- Sensor networks


Unlike grid computing, which is strongly associated with high-performance computing, cloud computing is much more than just providing lots of resources.
