# Distributed System : Architectur

## 2.1 Architectural styles
We start our discussion on architectures by first considering the logical organization of a distributed system into software components, also referred to as its
**software architecture**

Using components and connectors, we can come to various configurations,
which, in turn, have been classified into architectural styles. Several styles
have by now been identified, of which the most important ones for distributed
systems are:
- Layered architectures
- Object-based architectures
- Resource-centered architectures
- Event-based architectures

When a client binds to a distributed object, an implementation of the
object’s interface, called a *proxy*, is then loaded into the client’s address space.

#### 2.1.2 Object-based architectures
The server-side stub is often referred to as a *skeleton* as it provides the
bare means for letting the server middleware access the user-defined objects

Encapsulation is the keyword
here: the service as a whole is realized as a self-contained entity, although it
can possibly make use of other services.

In this way, we see that the problem of developing a distributed system is
partly one of service composition, and making sure that those services operate
in harmony.

#### 2.1.3 Resource-based architectures
One of the problems with service composition is that
connecting various components can easily turn into an integration nightmare
 
As an alternative, one can also view a distributed system as a huge 
collection of resources that are individually managed by components. Resources
may be added or removed by (remote) applications, and likewise can be
retrieved or modified.

There are four key characteristics of what are known as **RESTful architectures**:
1. Resources are identified through a single naming scheme
2. All services offer the same interface, consisting of at most four operations,as shown in Figure 2.7
3. Messages sent to or from a service are fully self-described
4. After executing an operation at a service, that component forgets everything about the call

#### 2.1.4 Publish-subscribe architectures
A large class of distributed systems
have adopted an architecture in which there is a strong separation between
processing and **coordination**.

In this model, coordination encompasses
the communication and cooperation between processes

Slightly adapting
their terminology, we make a distinction between models along two different
dimensions, **temporal** and **referential**

Clearly, in publish-subscribe systems such as these, the crucial issue is the
efficient and scalable implementation of matching subscriptions to notifications. From the outside, the publish-subscribe architecture provides lots of
potential for building very large-scale distributed systems due to the strong
decoupling of processes

## 2.2 Middleware organization
> 所以，到底什么是 middleware 呢？

Let us now zoom into the actual organization of middleware, that is, **independent of** the overall organization of a distributed system or application.

In particular,
there are two important types of design patterns that are often applied to the
organization of middleware: **wrappers** and **interceptors**

#### 2.2.1 Wrappers
A wrapper or adapter is a special component that offers an interface
acceptable to a client application, of which the functions are transformed
into those available at the component. In essence, it solves the problem of
incompatible interfaces

#### 2.2.2 Interceptors
Conceptually, an interceptor is nothing but a software construct that will
break the usual flow of control and allow other (application specific) code
to be executed

#### 2.2.3 Modifiable middlewa
And indeed, perhaps one of the most popular approaches toward modifiable middleware
is that of dynamically constructing middleware from components.

## 2.3 System architecture
> 感觉本section的内容是：server 如何放置的问题 !

Now that we have briefly discussed some commonly applied architectural
styles, let us take a look at how many distributed systems are actually
organized by considering *where software components are placed.*

Deciding
on software components, their interaction, and their placement leads to an
instance of a software architecture, also known as a system architecture
 

#### 2.3.1 Centralized organizatio
Since some requests are idempotent and others are not it should be clear that
there is no single solution for dealing with lost messages.

#### 2.3.2 Decentralized organizations: peer-to-peer systems
In modern architectures, it is often the distribution of the clients
and the servers that counts, which we refer to as **horizontal distribution**. In
this type of distribution, a client or server may be physically split up into
logically equivalent parts, but each part is operating on its own share of the
complete data set, thus balancing the load. In this section we will take a look
at a class of modern system architectures that support horizontal distribution,
known as peer-to-peer systems.

Given this symmetric behavior, peer-to-peer architectures evolve around
the question how to organize the processes in an overlay network [Tarkoma,
2010]: a network in which the nodes are formed by the processes and the links
represent the possible communication channels (which are often realized as
TCP connections).
