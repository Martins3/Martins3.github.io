# Distributed System : Communication

## 4.3 Message-oriented communication
Finally, we will examine message-queuing
systems that allow processes to exchange information, even if the other party is not executing at the time communication is initiated.


* **Simple transient messaging with sockets**

> 似乎就是讲了一下socket的各种知识

* **Advanced transient messaging**

One approach toward making network programming easier is based on the
observation that many messaging applications, or their components, can be
effectively organized according to a few simple communication patterns.

> 增加各种设计模式, 两个例子 : 
> 1. The Message-Passing Interface (MPI)
> 2. Using messaging patterns: ZeroMQ

* **Message-oriented persistent communication**

The essence of these systems is that
they offer intermediate-term storage capacity for messages, without requiring
either the sender or receiver to be active during message transmission.


## 4.4 Multicast communication


#### Gossip-based data dissemination

* **Information dissemination models**

Using the terminology from **epidemics**, a node that is part of a distributed
system is called infected if it holds data that it is willing to spread to other
nodes. A node that has not yet seen this data is called **susceptible**. Finally, an
updated node that is not willing or able to spread its data is said to have been
**removed**.
